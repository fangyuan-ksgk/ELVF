 Agent: So, Maria, after all the details we've gone through, what do you think about our life insurance policy? It really offers robust coverage and peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>I need to tell him why I think I don't need it.</reflect>Honestly, Alex, I feel like I don't really need it because I have enough assets to cover any emergencies. And besides, I already have my own emergency fund set up. 🙅

Agent: I understand where you're coming from, Maria. But life insurance can complement your assets and emergency fund, ensuring you and your loved ones are entirely covered. 

Maria: <reflect>He wants me to see life insurance as an addition. I should mention another reason.</reflect>Well, I’m also super healthy, you know? I eat right, exercise, and get regular checkups. So I don't see the need for life insurance right now. 🙆

Agent: That's great to hear! Being healthy is indeed crucial. But life insurance isn't just about health; it's about being prepared for any unforeseen circumstances. Even the healthiest person can face unexpected events.

Maria: <reflect>He's persistent. I need to bring up something else.</reflect>Another thing, Alex; I think it's just an unnecessary expense. I'm already managing my finances closely, and adding insurance seems like an extra burden. 🙅

Agent: I see. Budgeting is definitely important. But when you think about it, life insurance is an investment for your future and your family’s security. Imagine the peace of mind knowing they're financially secure no matter what happens.

Maria: <reflect>He has a point, but I'm still skeptical about the necessity.</reflect>Hmm, I guess that's true, but I feel like my financial advisor would know if I needed life insurance, and they haven't recommended it so far. 🤔

Agent: It’s good that you're consulting with a financial advisor. They do provide invaluable advice. However, I can offer additional insights specifically about insurance that they might not cover in detail. It's always good to get another perspective.

Maria: <reflect>He's suggesting more specialized knowledge. I have to think about this.</reflect>I see what you mean. Maybe I should consider it from that angle. But still, it feels like a big step. 🙆

Agent: Absolutely, it is a big step, which is why we're here to make it as clear and beneficial for you as possible. Perhaps seeing it as a safety net rather than an expense might help.

Maria: <reflect>He is really trying to frame it as a positive. What else should I ask about?</reflect>Okay, Alex, one more question. What happens if I decide to change my plan later on? Is that even possible? 💬

Agent: That's a great question, Maria. Yes, you can adjust your plan based on your needs and financial situation. We offer flexible options to make sure you're always getting the coverage that's right for you.

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility is good. But I'm still not entirely convinced.</reflect>Flexibility does sound appealing. But I've heard stories of people who couldn't claim their insurance when needed. How can I be sure that won't happen with FWD? 🤔

Agent: I can assure you, with FWD, the claims process is transparent and straightforward. We have a strong track record of honoring our commitments to our clients. Plus, our advisors, like myself, are here to guide you through every step.

Maria: <reflect>It sounds reassuring, but I'm thinking about the cost again.</reflect>I appreciate the assurance. But what about the premiums? How are they calculated, and could they become a financial strain later? 🙆

Agent: Our premiums are calculated based on several factors, including age, health, and the type of coverage you choose. We aim to keep them affordable and manageable for all our clients, ensuring you’re not financially strained now or in the future.

Maria: <reflect>Information on pricing is good. But the decision is still tough.</reflect>Alright, Alex, that's helpful to know. This decision is tougher than I expected. 🙆

Agent: I totally get it, Maria. Taking your time to make an informed decision is crucial. Would it help if I provided some case studies or client testimonials to give you a better idea?

Maria: <reflect>Case studies could be helpful, but I need to digest this info first.</reflect>Maybe that could help. But for now, I need to think about everything we've discussed. 🙆

Agent: Absolutely, take your time. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, I'm always here to help.

Maria: <reflect>He's being really supportive. I appreciate that.</reflect>Thank you, Alex. I'll definitely keep that mind. 🙏
