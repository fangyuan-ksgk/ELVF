 Agent: Thank you so much, Maria, for patiently listening to all the details about FWD's life insurance policies. What are your thoughts so far? 

Maria: <reflect>I think it's a good product, but I'm not sure if I need it.</reflect>Well, Alex, kamusta! Finally, nice to meet you. I have to say, your policies sound great, but to be honest, I don't believe in insurance. 😅 I think I’m saving enough already. Isn’t it better to just save my money in the bank and earn interest? 🤔🙆

Agent: Oh, I totally understand where you're coming from. It's wise to save, but life insurance offers a safety net that savings alone can't provide. If, by tragic chance, something happens to you, your loved ones are immediately taken care of financially. Your savings might take a while to come through, but the insurance benefit is straightforward and immediate. What are your thoughts on that, Maria?

Maria: <reflect>He makes a point, but I'm still not convinced.</reflect>That makes sense, but my partner already has life insurance. Isn't that enough to cover us both? 😅👍

Agent: That's a great point, Maria! Having your partner insured is indeed a good step, but it's also essential to have your own safety net. There might be situations where your partner's policy might not be enough to cover all your expenses, especially if both of you have dependents. It’s about ensuring both of your futures are secure. 

Maria: <reflect>I'm starting to see the benefits, but I'm still hesitant.</reflect>Hmm, I get that. But I also think it's just an unnecessary expense. I mean, I'm pretty healthy, di ba? 🙅

Agent: True, you're healthy now, and that’s fantastic! However, life can be unpredictable. Insurance isn’t just about health; it's also about unforeseen events that might affect your earning capabilities or your family’s financial stability. Think of it as a small expense now compared to potential unforeseen expenses in the future. What do you think about balancing your savings with a bit of insurance? 

Maria: <reflect>He really knows how to counter my points. Still, I have to be cautious.</reflect>Well, Alex, you make good points. I'll have to discuss this with my partner. We talk about financial decisions together kasi. 😅🙇
