 Agent: I can see that you have some thoughts regarding the policy, Maria. It's understandable, and I'm here to listen. By the way, did you like our iced coffee here?

Maria: <reflect>Need to smoothly transition to my concerns</reflect> Yeah, the iced coffee is great! Pero, Alex, to be honest, I have a few concerns kasi. ðŸ™†

Agent: Sure, Maria. That's what I'm here for. Ano po yun? Let's address them one by one.

Maria: <reflect>I should start with my budget problem.</reflect> So, to be honest, my salary isn't enough to spend on insurance right now. Iâ€™m still paying off a loan pa nga. ðŸ˜¢

Agent: I understand, Maria. Many people feel that way initially. But think about this: if something happens, having insurance can actually be a big help in preventing financial stress, and we do have flexible payment options. Could we explore a plan that fits your current budget?

Maria: <reflect>Flexible payment options sound good, pero I should mention my priority on savings.</reflect> Flexible sounds good, Alex, but I also think it's better to save my money in the bank to earn interest. ðŸ¤”

Agent: That's a valid point, Maria. However, insurance and saving serve different purposes. While a bank account is great for saving, insurance provides financial protection and peace of mind. It's not just about interest; it's about being prepared for the unexpected.

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s right about that. But how can I commit to another expense?</reflect> Okay, but how do I justify this extra expense when Iâ€™m already managing my budget tightly? ðŸ™†

Agent: I get where you're coming from, Maria. We can start with something very basic and cost-effective, designed especially for situations like this. Over time, as your financial situation improves, you can consider increasing the coverage. How does that sound?

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s really making it sound reasonable, but let me think about my current obligations.</reflect> Hmm, that sounds a bit better, pero right now, I feel like any additional expense would be a stretch. ðŸ™…

Agent: I understand, Maria. Another thing to consider is that the sooner you start, the lower your premiums might be, since age and health are significant factors. Itâ€™s a long-term investment in your future security. 

Maria: <reflect>He's giving valid points, but I need to see if he can offer more benefits.</reflect> I get that, but what specific benefits will I get from this policy that makes it worth the stretch now? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Great question, Maria. Aside from the obvious financial protection, our policies also offer benefits such as critical illness coverage, accidental death benefits, and even some that have investment components, meaning your money can grow over time. Think of it as hitting two birds with one stoneâ€”protection and growth.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds more appealing, but I still have my doubts.</reflect> Interesting, but I still feel Iâ€™m not sure if I need it right now, lalo na my partner already has life insurance.ðŸ¤”

Agent: I get that, Maria. While itâ€™s great that your partner has coverage, having your own policy ensures that youâ€™re directly protected as well. Itâ€™s about having that personal safety net. Imagine if your partner's policy wouldnâ€™t cover what you specifically need. Itâ€™s about securing your own peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>He's really making some good points, pero still on the fence.</reflect> Ang dami kong kailangan i-consider, Alex. I'm healthy naman kasi, kaya I feel like it's an unnecessary expense. ðŸ™…

Agent: And that's wonderful to hear, Maria! Being healthy today is a blessing, but insurance isn't just for when you're sick. Itâ€™s for life's unpredictability. Think about accidents or unforeseen events. It's about safeguarding your hard-earned assets and making sure you and your family are always protected, no matter what.

Maria: <reflect>That makes sense, but I should also think about future plans.</reflect> Mm, I'll have to think about that. Also, can these policies be adjusted based on my future plansâ€”like if I start a family? ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely! Our policies are highly flexible and can be adjusted as your life circumstances change. Starting a family, buying a home, or even planning for retirementâ€”we have options to match each milestone.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, flexibility is a plus. How about their customer service?</reflect> Flexibility is great. But how is the customer service? I'd want to make sure I can easily get in touch if I need to make changes or have questions.ðŸ™†

Agent: We pride ourselves on excellent customer service, Maria. We have a 24/7 helpline and dedicated advisors who can assist you whenever you need it. Plus, we have an online portal where you can manage your policy and make updates easily.

Maria: <reflect>Having 24/7 support is really good. He covered most of my concerns, but I still need to process everything before deciding.</reflect> That sounds promising. Mukhang your policy has a lot of benefits nga, but thereâ€™s still a lot to consider.ðŸ™†
