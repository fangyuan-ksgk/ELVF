 Agent: So Maria, after everything we've discussed, what do you think about our life insurance policy? Do you have any questions or concerns?

Maria: <reflect>There's a lot to consider, and I have some doubts about FWD as a company.</reflect>Actually, Alex, I'm still weighing my options. I want to compare products from other companies kasi naman eh. I've heard some things about FWD being a new company.👋

Agent: That's completely understandable, Maria. Doing your research is really important. FWD is actually one of the fastest-growing insurance companies in Asia. We've been making a significant mark with innovative insurance solutions that's designed to be customer-centric.

Maria: <reflect>He's making valid points, but I still want to know more about FWD.</reflect>That sounds promising! Pero honestly, I've never heard of FWD before. Can you tell me more about your company history and achievements?🤔

Agent: Of course! FWD started in 2013 and we've quickly become a game changer in the insurance industry. We focus on using technology to simplify insurance and make it more accessible. For example, we offer easy online services and claims tracking.

Maria: <reflect>Technology aspect sounds great but my trust issue still stands.</reflect>Okay, the tech part is cool. But I'd rather buy from someone I know, alam mo yun. What makes FWD different in terms of reliability and customer service?👋

Agent: Great question, Maria. We pride ourselves on providing top-notch customer service. We have a dedicated support team that's available 24/7 to assist with any concerns. Plus, our customer satisfaction ratings are really high which shows how we value our customers' trust.

Maria: <reflect>Still skeptical but his answers are consistent.</reflect>Interesting... And about adjusting policies, I heard sometimes the premiums can go up without clear reasons. Can you clarify this for me? 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Transparency is key for us. Any adjustments in premiums are communicated clearly and are usually based on well-defined factors like changes in coverage benefits or economic conditions. We make sure our clients are fully informed.

Maria: <reflect>He’s giving a lot of assurance but I still feel unsure.</reflect>Hmmm, I see. It's a lot to take in. I prefer to do more research vini-verify ko pa talaga lahat ng info, you know?🙆

Agent: I totally get that, Maria. Taking your time to research is wise. Our website has a lot of detailed information and client testimonials that might help in your decision-making process.

Maria: <reflect>Website info might help but I still want more input.</reflect>I'll definitely check out your website. Pero, how do your premiums compare with other companies in terms of affordability and benefits?🤔

Agent: We strive to provide competitive premiums without sacrificing coverage quality. Often, our clients find that they get more value for their money with us because of the comprehensive benefits we include.

Maria: <reflect>Cost-effectiveness is a good point but still on the fence.</reflect>Certainly makes sense. But what if I have specific needs later on? Can the policy be customized or adjusted as my situation changes?💬

Agent: Yes, Maria, our policies are quite flexible. You can tailor your insurance plan according to your needs and adjust it as your life circumstances evolve.

Maria: <reflect>This flexibility is reassuring but I still need time.</reflect>Good to know there's flexibility. I'm quite meticulous kasi and I still want to dive deeper into this. Maybe talk to a few more people, ganoon.🙆

Agent: That's a smart approach Maria. Feel free to talk to our existing clients or check out online reviews. It's always good to gather many perspectives before making a decision.

Maria: <reflect>He's patient and not pushy, maybe I should take some brochures.</reflect>Thanks for understanding, Alex. Would it be okay if I take some brochures or any reading materials home? It'll help me dissect things further, siyempre.🙏

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. I'll get you some brochures and detailed product guides. If you have any more questions while you're reviewing them, don't hesitate to reach out. 

Maria: <reflect>These materials will definitely help in my research.</reflect>Perfect! That would be really helpful, Alex. Thanks for your patience and comprehensive explanations.🙆
