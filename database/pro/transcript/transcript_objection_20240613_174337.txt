 Agent: And that's really what makes our policy stand out. It's all about providing peace of mind for your family. So, Maria, how do you feel about what we've discussed so far?

Maria: <reflect> I need to bring up my concerns about money. The premiums are too expensive for my budget. I'll mention that. </reflect> Well, to be honest, Alex, the premiums sound really high. I'm not sure if I can fit that into my budget right now.

Agent: I totally get that, Maria. Budgets are tight these days. But have you considered how a plan like this can be a long-term investment? The peace of mind and financial security are worth it.

Maria: <reflect> I really have no budget. I need to emphasize that insurance is not a priority for me right now. </reflect> I understand the benefits, but I really have no budget for this right now. My salary is barely enough to cover my daily expenses.

Agent: That's understandable. Have you thought about starting with a more basic plan and then upgrading when you're more comfortable financially? It's a way to get some coverage without straining your wallet.

Maria: <reflect> I still have loans to pay off. He needs to know that too. </reflect> Hmm, that's an interesting idea. But I also have to mention that I'm still paying off my loan. Adding another expense is really hard for me.

Agent: Paying off loans can be tough, I understand. Think of it this way though, having even minimal insurance could prevent you from going deeper into debt in case something unexpected happens.

Maria: <reflect> I really want to save money instead, but I should seem open-minded. </reflect> I see your point, Alex. I just think maybe saving money directly in the bank might be more practical for me at this point.

Agent: Direct savings are good, yes. But have you considered how insurance can also serve as a form of savings? Some of our plans offer cash value that you can use later on.

Maria: <reflect> I should mention I have an emergency fund already. </reflect> I actually already have an emergency fund. So I'm not entirely without a safety net, you know?

Agent: That's great to hear! Having an emergency fund is a fantastic start. Insurance can complement that by covering larger, unforeseen expenses that your emergency fund might not fully cover.

Maria: <reflect> I should ask more about this cash value thing he mentioned. </reflect> Okay, tell me more about this cash value. How does it actually work?

Agent: Sure, with our policies, a portion of your premiums can accumulate as cash value over time. You can borrow against this amount, or even withdraw it if needed, which adds another layer of financial security.

Maria: <reflect> It sounds interesting, but Iâ€™m still skeptical about adding another expense to my life. </reflect> That does sound interesting, Alex, but I'm still skeptical about adding another expense to my life right now.

Agent: I completely get where you're coming from. Maybe think of it as diversifying your financial safety net. You're not just adding an expense, you're investing in your future.

Maria: <reflect> I should ask about the commitment length of these policies. </reflect> Okay, if I were to consider it, how long would I be committed to these policies? 

Agent: Great question! It really depends on the plan. We have options ranging from short-term to long-term commitments. Some plans even have flexible terms to adjust as your financial situation improves.

Maria: <reflect> Thatâ€™s good to know. I should express that I'm still hesitant. </reflect> That's good to know, but Iâ€™m still hesitant to commit fully right now. 

Agent: Totally understandable. Why not take some time to think about it? Meanwhile, I can send you some more detailed information you can review at your own pace.

Maria: <reflect> Itâ€™s good to have more information, but Iâ€™ll express my ongoing concern about money. </reflect> Sure, more information would be helpful. But like I said earlier, the monetary side is really my main concern.

Agent: I hear you, Maria. Let's take it step-by-step. Maybe starting small, as we discussed, could be a more manageable way to get you started on securing your future.

Maria: <reflect> I still feel that I have my doubts, but Iâ€™ll show some open-mindedness. </reflect> Alright, Alex. I appreciate you taking the time to explain all of this. Iâ€™ll think it over. ðŸ™†
