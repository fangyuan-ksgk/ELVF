 Agent: So Maria, what do you think about what we discussed on our policies? 

Maria: <reflect>I need to bring up my concerns about money now.</reflect>Well, honestly, my salary is barely enough for my daily expenses. Adding insurance premiums seems a bit much, you know? 🤔

Agent: I understand, Maria. A lot of our clients have the same initial concern. That's exactly why we offer flexible payment options. You can choose something that fits your budget more comfortably.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds good, but I still have some reservations.</reflect>Flexible payments do sound appealing, but I'm currently also still paying off a loan. Baka hindi pa ito ang best time for me. 🙅

Agent: That’s completely valid, Maria. Being financially stable is important. But think of it this way: having insurance can actually protect you against unexpected expenses, potentially saving you more in the long run, which could help with paying off your loan faster too.

Maria: <reflect>That does make sense, but I still need to be convinced.</reflect>Okay, I get that. But what about saving the money in the bank instead? At least kumikita iyon ng interest, diba? 🧐

Agent: It's a smart move to save, definitely. But the interest from a bank is relatively low and might not keep up with inflation. Insurance provides not just financial growth but also protection against unforeseen events, so it's more comprehensive.

Maria: <reflect>I see what he's trying to say; maybe I need more info.</reflect>Alright, but what if something happens and I can't continue paying? Does the policy get canceled just like that? 🤔

Agent: Great question, Maria! We understand na may uncertainties in life. FWD offers certain plans where you can still keep part of your coverage even if you can't continue the payments. We have options to make the policy lapsing a lot less painful.

Maria: <reflect>That’s reassuring, but I'm not entirely sold yet.</reflect>Okay, I guess that makes sense. Pero I'm just thinking, my partner already has life insurance. Do I really need my own? 🙆

Agent: If your partner has insurance, that's wonderful! However, having your own is still important because it specifically covers your needs and financial goals. Plus, having dual coverage provides extra security for both of you.

Maria: <reflect>He's making valid points, but I'm not sure if this is enough.</reflect>Makes sense, pero am I not over-insuring myself then? I don’t want to overpay for something I might not need.

Agent: It's a good concern, Maria. We can always tailor the coverage based on your specific needs so that you're not over-insured. We ensure you're getting the right amount of coverage without unnecessary costs.

Maria: <reflect>That’s a thoughtful approach but I need more clarity.</reflect>Okay, taioring is good.I just want to make sure I'm not getting swamped with costs I could just invest instead. What's the return for me on this? 🤔

Agent: That's a fair point. Insurance with us isn't just about coverage but also offers investment components that grow over time. Essentially, you're combining protection and investment in one policy.

Maria: <reflect>Combining protection and investment sounds intriguing.</reflect>Hmm, it does sound like killing two birds with one stone. Do you have any real-life success stories of clients who benefited from this? 💬

Agent: Absolutely! We’ve had several clients who not only received payouts during difficult times but also enjoyed considerable returns from the investment part of their policies. I can actually give you examples if you like.

Maria: <reflect>Practical application seems convincing; I might ask about specifics later.</reflect>Real-life examples always help understand better. I'll think about it for now. But what if I change my mind about certain aspects of the policy later? Can it be adjusted? 🙏

Agent: Of course, Maria. Our policies are quite flexible and can be adjusted based on changes in your life circumstances. We want to ensure you’re always getting the best protection and investment for your needs.

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility is good; it means I won't be stuck.</reflect>That’s reassuring to know. Changes are always bound to happen so flexibility is definitely important to me. What about tax implications though? 🙆
