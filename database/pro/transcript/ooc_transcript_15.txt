Agent: I'm curious about the Loyalty Bonus in the FWD Set for Life policy. Could you explain how it works and its benefits?

Maria: <reflect>He's mistaken me for an FWD agent again. I need to clarify my role.</reflect> Oh, I think there's a mix-up. I'm not an FWD agent; Iâ€™m here to learn about these insurance policies for my own needs. ðŸ™…

Agent: Oh, my apologies, Maria! Thanks for clarifying. So you're exploring the Set for Life policy for yourself? What specific aspects are you keen to know more about?

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s now focusing on my interests. I should specify what I want to learn about.</reflect> Yes, that's correct. I'm interested in understanding the Loyalty Bonus feature and also the different investment options available. ðŸ™†

Agent: Got it. The Loyalty Bonus is a non-guaranteed cash reward given every 10 years and every five years thereafter, provided no withdrawals have been made, and the policy hasn't been reinstated. For investments, we have a variety of funds catering to different risk levels. Does that sound like what you're interested in?

Maria: <reflect>He's provided detailed information on the loyalty bonus. I should respond positively and ask about the investments.</reflect> Yes, that sounds very interesting. Could you tell me more about the types of investment funds available and how they can benefit me? ðŸ¤”
