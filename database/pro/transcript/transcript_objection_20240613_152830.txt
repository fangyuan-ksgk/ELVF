 Agent: Maria, I know itâ€™s a lot to process, but with FWD insurance, you do get fantastic coverage for critical care, our premiums are quite competitive, and the support system is just top-notch. What do you think?

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, I should express my reservations about FWD. I haven't heard of this company before.</reflect>You know, I haven't heard of FWD before. Is this some new company?ðŸ¤”

Agent: I understand where youâ€™re coming from, Maria. FWD is relatively new to the Philippine market, but we're backed by a Hong Kong-based investment group, Pacific Century Group. We've also grown steadily across several Asian countries since our launch.

Maria: <reflect>Well, I need to compare FWD with other options.</reflect>That's interesting, but I still want to compare your products with other companies. I'm very thorough with these things, you know. ðŸ™…

Agent: That's totally reasonable, Maria. In fact, I encourage you to do so. FWD prides itself on transparency, and you can easily find our products listed and compared on major insurance platforms. We are confident in our offerings and believe you'll see the value we provide.

Maria: <reflect>What if I feel like I could find better elsewhere?</reflect>Okay, pero, what if I can find better insurance elsewhere? Most of the time, it's about finding the right fit and sometimes that means somewhere else. ðŸ¤”

Agent: Absolutely, and I get that. However, what sets FWD apart is our flexibility and customer-centered approach. We want to provide the best solutions for your needs, not just sell you a product. Our customer service and claims process are highly rated for being efficient and supportive, something you might not find everywhere.

Maria: <reflect>This sounds promising, but I'm skeptical about policy adjustments.</reflect>I also heard na, you can't adjust your policy later on if you need to. How true is that? ðŸ™…

Agent: Actually, thatâ€™s a common misconception. FWD allows adjustments for life changes, like marriage or having children. Our policies are designed to adapt with your lifestyle and needs, so you wonâ€™t feel trapped in a rigid framework.

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing my concerns well; I should learn more details.</reflect>That's nice, pero can I hear more about how you handle premium increases and other changes? I heard it's common for premiums to go up without clear reasons. 

Agent: Great point, Maria. At FWD, we make sure any premium increases are well-communicated and justified. We offer regular reviews to make sure you understand any changes and why they happen. Whether your premium goes up will depend on factors like coverage expansion, benefit levels, and policy changes you've personally requested.

Maria: <reflect>He's pretty convincing, but I still need more assurance.</reflect>Okay, I'm glad to hear that. But I also want to make sure I'm not overpaying for coverage I don't need. Sometimes insurance companies have a way of adding unnecessary extras. ðŸ™†

Agent: Completely agree, Maria. You shouldn't be paying for what you don't need. We offer a personalized needs assessment to ensure your policy fits just rightâ€”nothing more, nothing less. Plus, our advisors are always available to talk through any concerns you have about your coverage.

Maria: <reflect>This sounds better, but I should ask about their recent performance.</reflect>Interesting! How has FWD been performing in terms of customer satisfaction and claim settlements? You know, word of mouth travels fast. ðŸ™†

Agent: I'm glad you asked, Maria. FWD has earned high customer satisfaction across Asia, including consistent top ratings on claim settlements. We've even streamlined the claims process so you can settle your claims more swiftly and without hassle. We're committed to transparency and efficiency.

Maria: <reflect>He's really selling the legitimacy of FWD. I'll ask about the long-term benefits.</reflect>Okay, sounds legit. How about the long-term benefits of having an FWD policy? Is it really worth it in the long run? ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely! With FWD, you not only get comprehensive life and health protection, but we also offer financial planning support to ensure your investments and savings grow in line with your life goals. We aim to give you peace of mind and financial stability for years to come.

Maria: <reflect>This is starting to sound more appealing, I should see if he's free to discuss more specifics another time.</reflect>Hmm, you almost have me there. Maybe we can discuss the specific plans and rates in more detail next time? I'm curious but still a bit on the fence. ðŸ™†

Agent: That sounds like a plan, Maria. I'm here to provide all the information you need. Anytime you're ready for another session, just let me know. Meanwhile, feel free to compare and research more about us. 

Maria: <reflect>He's very reassuring, I'll keep the conversation open on my end.</reflect>Thanks, Alex. That's really helpful. I'll do my research and get back to you with more questions. ðŸ™†

Agent: Perfect! I'm here whenever you're ready, Maria. If there are any more questions or concerns, feel free to reach out anytime.

Maria: <reflect>I'll show some gratitude and keep the conversation going.</reflect>Appreciate it, Alex. You're quite the convincing agent. You almost made this insurance talk fun! Let's keep in touch. ðŸ™†
