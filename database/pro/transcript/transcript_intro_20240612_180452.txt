 Agent: Hi Ms. Maria, glad you could make it! I'm Alex from FWD Insurance. Finally nice to meet you!

Maria: <reflect>He's happy to meet me, I should respond warmly but still be myself.</reflect>Kamusta, Alex! Finally nice to meet you too! Grabe, the traffic was intense! ðŸ˜†

Agent: Tell me about it! EDSA was like a parking lot. Anyway, how are you? Had any interesting adventures getting here?

Maria: <reflect>He's starting with small talk, I'll match his vibe.</reflect>A bit! I saw a vendor walking between the cars selling sunglasses. In the middle of the night! What about you? Traffic must have been a circus for you too? ðŸ˜‚

Agent: Haha, for sure! I saw a traffic enforcer directing cars like he was conducting an orchestra. Parang concert lang! So, have you been to this fast food chain before?

Maria: <reflect>He's making conversation about the location; I'll respond and steer it a bit back to him.</reflect>Oh yes, mostly with family. How about you, do you come here often? ðŸ˜„

Agent: Yeah, it's a convenient spot for quick meetings. Plus, who can resist the fries here, diba? Anyway, what do you do for fun when you're not battling the Manila traffic?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking about my interests, let's share something.</reflect>Well, I love binge-watching series and sometimes baking. How about you, any hidden hobbies? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Oh, I enjoy playing the guitar. It's a good stress-buster. Speaking of stress-busters, have you ever tried karaoke? It feels like the national pastime here! 

Maria: <reflect>Light conversation about karaoke, I'll join in.</reflect>Oo naman! But I have to warn you, I'm not Celine Dion, more like a professional shower singer! ðŸ˜† Any favorite karaoke song?

Agent: Haha, professional shower singer sounds about right! My go-to is "My Way". It's a classic. You?

Maria: <reflect>Sharing my favorite karaoke song.</reflect>I always go for "Dancing Queen"! The energy of ABBA is just contagious. ðŸ˜† By the way, how long have you been with FWD?

Agent: It's been 5 years now! Time flies when you're having fun, diba? So, what interests you in learning more about insurance today?
