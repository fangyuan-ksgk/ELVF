 Maria: <reflect>He's given a thorough explanation of the insurance policy, let's see how he addresses these concerns.</reflect>You know, Alex, I really appreciate the details you provided. But the thing is, I believe it's better to just save the money in a bank to earn interest.🤔

Agent: That’s a good point, Maria. Saving money in the bank is always a good idea. However, the interest from a bank is usually quite low compared to the potential benefits of an insurance policy. Our insurance not only gives you protection but also offers good returns over the long term. Plus, it gives you peace of mind knowing your loved ones are protected.

Maria: <reflect>He's making some good points, but there's still more reasons I'm hesitant.</reflect>Mmm, interesting... pero my partner already has life insurance, so I don't really see the need for another one.💬

Agent: I understand, Maria. It's wonderful that your partner is already covered. However, having your own policy ensures you're personally protected and gives you additional financial security. In case anything happens to either of you, you wouldn't have to worry about financial strain.

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing my concerns well, but there's one more thing.</reflect>Okay, okay, I see where you are coming from. But honestly, I just don't want to overpay for coverage I don't need. 🙅

Agent: I completely get that, Maria. Overpaying for something you don't need is never a good idea. What we can do is customize a plan that suits your specific needs and budget. This way, you’re only paying for what’s necessary and beneficial for you and your family.

Maria: <reflect>He's really trying to make sure it fits my needs. Let's see how he handles more direct interaction.</reflect>That sounds reasonable. But how exact are those customized plans? Can I really adjust everything to match my lifestyle and budget? 🤔 

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Our plans are highly flexible. We can adjust coverage amounts, add or remove certain benefits, and alter payment terms to make sure it aligns perfectly with your lifestyle and financial capacity. This way, you’re only getting what you truly need.

Maria: <reflect>This product seems versatile, but I'm still not fully convinced.</reflect>Well, sabihin na nating I might consider it. But before anything else, can you give me an example of how flexible an insurance plan can really be? 🙆

Agent: Sure thing, Maria. Take for example our comprehensive life insurance plan. We can start with basic coverage and then add rider benefits like critical illness coverage, education fund for your children, or even investment options to grow your money. And if your financial situation changes, we can always make adjustments accordingly.

Maria: <reflect>He's making this sound very attractive and informative.</reflect>Wow, that does sound pretty flexible. I'm actually quite amazed at how you can adjust those terms. So, you're saying I can update it as my financial situation changes? 👍

Agent: Yes, exactly, Maria! Life is unpredictable and it’s essential to have a plan that evolves with you. Our goal is to ensure that you are always adequately protected without feeling financially burdened. 

Maria: <reflect>This may actually be more practical than I initially thought.</reflect>Okay, Alex. I’m quite interested but still a bit cautious. If I do consider getting a policy, what would be the first step? 🙆

Agent: Great to hear you're interested, Maria! The first step would be to sit down with one of our financial advisors to thoroughly assess your needs and financial goals. From there, we can recommend the best plan that suits you.

Maria: <reflect>Detailed information is always good; let's see how this initial step works.</reflect>Makes sense. How long does this assessment usually take? I want to ensure I have ample time to understand everything.🤔

Agent: Typically, the assessment takes about an hour. During this time, we go through your current financial status, future goals, and any specific needs you might have. We want to make sure you’re comfortable and informed every step of the way.

Agent: I'm glad to help, Maria. Your understanding and peace of mind are our priorities. Is there anything else you might want to ask or clarify?

Maria: <reflect>I'm feeling quite comfortable with his answers so far...</reflect>Hmm, I think you've covered most of my concerns. If anything, I might just need a bit more time to mull over it.👍
