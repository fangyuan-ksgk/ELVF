 Agent: So Maria, I'm glad you had the time to go over the details of our product. With the benefits we discussed, I'm confident it can really make a difference for you. Any thoughts or questions so far?

Maria: <reflect>I should mention some concerns para makita ko how he addresses them.</reflect>Well, Alex, honestly I have some apprehensions. Like, for example, I’ve never heard of FWD before. What is FWD exactly?🤔

Agent: That's a valid question, Maria. FWD is actually a relatively new player in the Philippine market, but we're part of an established Pan-Asian insurance group. We focus on making insurance easy to understand and accessible. Are you familiar with other insurance companies?

Maria: <reflect>Sounds interesting but still, I need more reassurance.</reflect>Oh, okay. I've heard of some other brands kasi. I'm just concerned if there might be premium increases without clear reasons, you know?😟

Agent: Ah, I get where you're coming from. With FWD, we emphasize transparency. Any changes in your premiums or policy will be communicated well in advance, and we always make sure that our clients are clear about the reasons behind such changes. Does that ease your concern a bit?

Maria: <reflect>Okay, transparency is good. Let me bring up another concern, though.</reflect>Another thing, Alex. Since FWD is new, will I be able to adjust my policy later on if I need to? Like, when my needs change?🤔

Agent: Definitely, Maria. One of the key features of our products is flexibility. We understand that your needs and circumstances change over time, so we offer options to adjust your coverage or even switch policies when needed. How does that sound to you?

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility sounds good. Let me share about my budget concerns next.</reflect>Well, Alex, I have to be honest. Right now, I'm really focused on saving money. I mean, I have other priorities, like paying off my loan.💬

Agent: I appreciate your honesty, Maria. Budget concerns are totally understandable. We offer a range of policies that can fit different budgets, including lower-premium options that still offer substantial coverage. Would you like to hear more about those? 

Maria: <reflect>I suppose knowing more options wouldn't hurt.</reflect>Yes, sure. How low can those premiums go, though? I need something that's really budget-friendly.🤔 

Agent: We have policies starting from as low as a couple of thousand pesos per year, depending on your age and the level of coverage you choose. This way, you can ease into it without putting too much strain on your finances. Does that sound viable for you?

Maria: <reflect>Okay, that sounds doable, but I still want to make a comparison...</reflect>Hmm, it does. But to be transparent with you, I still want to compare products from other companies. I mean, just to make sure I'm getting the best deal, di ba?🤔

Agent: Totally understand where you're coming from, Maria. It's actually wise to compare options. Just make sure you’re looking not just at the premiums, but also at the benefits and flexibility. Meanwhile, would you mind if I prepare a customized quote for you? 

Maria: <reflect>A customized quote sounds tailored to my needs...</reflect>Okay, that can help. Just curious, though. Can this quote be adjusted later as well if I have more questions or changes?🙆

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. The quote can be adjusted anytime to better fit your needs. We want to make sure you’re comfortable and satisfied with the policy before making any commitments. Anything specific you'd like me to include in the quote?

Maria: <reflect>He seems accommodating; I should mention specific needs.</reflect>Well, considering my budget, maybe focus on essential coverage. Also, I'd like to know about any potential additional charges. Is that okay?🙏

Agent: Noted, Maria. I’ll make sure to provide all the details, including any additional charges so there are no surprises. You mentioned essentials. Is there any specific type of coverage you’re particularly interested in, like health, accident, or life?

Maria: <reflect>I need to think which is more essential for me.</reflect>Siguro, life insurance would be a good start since that's something really important. But let me think if there’s anything else. Can I get back to you on that?🤔

Agent: Of course, Maria. Take your time to think it over. Meanwhile, I'll draft the basic quote for life insurance and leave room for any adjustments. We can discuss it further once you're ready. Deal?

Maria: <reflect>He’s giving me some time, that’s good.</reflect>Okay, deal. Thanks, Alex. This has been really helpful. So, do you have any personal experience with the policies you're selling?🙆
