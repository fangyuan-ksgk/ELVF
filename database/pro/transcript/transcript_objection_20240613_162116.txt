 Agent: So Maria, as we wrap up discussing the details of our life insurance plans.. How does it sound to you so far? Any thoughts or concerns you'd like to share?

Maria: <reflect>Okay, time to voice out some of my concerns. I really want to compare products from other companies first before making a decision. That would be better for me.🙆</reflect>Well Alex, thank you for all the information. But you know, I really want to compare products from other companies din before I make a decision. 🙆

Agent: I understand, Maria. It's always good to compare and see which one fits you best. But did you know that FWD offers several unique benefits like no lifetime limit and even cancer coverage? Would you like more details on that?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to showcase the benefits, but I still prefer to do my own research.🤔</reflect>That sounds unique, Alex. Pero you see, I also prefer to do my own research. Ang dami kasing options out there e.🤔

Agent: Absolutely, it's wise to do your research. If you have any specific points you'd like to know more about—whether it's about our assistance in the claims process or the specifics about premium payments—we're very transparent and happy to provide detailed answers.

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing my trust issues by offering transparency. But you know, I've heard about premium increases without clear reasons din kasi.😢</reflect>Hmm, that's good to know. But then I also heard about premium increases without clear reasons. Napansin ko lang yun sa ibang companies kaya medyo hesitant ako. 😢

Agent: Oh, I get that concern. With FWD, however, any premium increase is well-communicated and typically aligned with adjustments in coverage or risk. You’ll never be surprised by hidden costs; everything is laid out upfront.

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing the transparency issue well, but maybe it's better talaga to buy from someone I know personally. That gives me more peace of mind.🙅</reflect>Okay, that’s nice. But honestly, I'd rather buy insurance from someone I know personally. It just gives me more peace of mind, you know?  🙅

Agent: I get you, Maria. Familiarity does build trust. But think of us at FWD as friends you haven't met yet. Our policies are designed to be straightforward and beneficial—like a friend looking out for you. And you can always rely on our customer service for that personal touch.

Maria: <reflect>He's putting a friend-like approach. I'll consider it but I still have doubts. 🙏</reflect>That's a comforting thought, Alex. I'll keep that in mind. 🙏

Agent: Thanks, Maria. And remember, you can always reach out if you have any questions or need more information. We're here to make sure you understand everything fully before you decide.

Maria: <reflect>He's really trying to reassure me. Maybe I can ask about how flexible the policies are.🙆</reflect>Fair enough. Just one more thing, how flexible are your policies? Like can I adjust them later if my needs change? 🙆

Agent: Great question! Yes, our policies are quite flexible. You can make adjustments depending on your life changes such as marriage, having children, or even career shifts. We aim to make it as adaptable as your life is.

Maria: <reflect>That flexibility is good. Still, I'll need to think this through. 🤔</reflect>That sounds good to know. But I'll have to think this through pa rin. 🤔

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Take your time. I can provide you with brochures and even some testimonials from clients who have benefited from our flexibility if that would help.

Maria: <reflect>Brochures and testimonials could be useful. I'll respond positively. 🙏</reflect>Sure, I think that could be helpful. Would love to see those. 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, I'll get those sent over to you. Is there any other information you'd need to help you make an informed decision?

Maria: <reflect>He’s thorough but I should ask about long-term benefits before any decisions. 💬</reflect>Thanks! One last thing, can you tell me a bit about the long-term benefits of choosing FWD? 💬

Agent: Certainly! In the long-term, you'll benefit from peace of mind knowing that you're covered for critical illnesses, hospitalizations, and even death. Plus, your family gets financial security which is invaluable. And as you live healthier, you can even get rebates on your premiums.

Maria: <reflect>The long-term benefits do sound promising. I'll have to ponder on this.🤔</reflect>Okay, those long-term benefits do sound promising. I'll really have to ponder on this, Alex. 🤔

Agent: I completely understand, Maria. It's a big decision and deserves your thought. If there's anything else you need or any questions that come up later, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Maria: <reflect>He's genuinely helpful. Maybe I should acknowledge that and ask about how to contact him later, just to be thorough. 🙆</reflect>Thanks for being so helpful, Alex. If I wanted to contact you later, what's the best way? 🙆
