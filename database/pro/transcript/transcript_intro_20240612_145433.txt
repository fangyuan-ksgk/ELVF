Maria: <reflect>He’s diving deeper into specific needs. I should outline my main concerns.</reflect>My main concerns are covering any outstanding debts and ensuring there's a safety net for any unforeseen circumstances. What options would you suggest in this context?🤔

Agent: Based on what you've mentioned, a term life insurance policy could address those concerns effectively. It provides coverage for a specified term and can be cost-effective while you’re paying off debts. How does that align with what you’re thinking?

Maria: <reflect>He’s suggesting something specific. I should express my thoughts and ask for more details.</reflect>That sounds reasonable. Can you explain more about how term life insurance works and its key benefits?🤔
