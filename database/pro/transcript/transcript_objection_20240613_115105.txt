 Agent: So Maria, after discussing everything about our comprehensive life insurance policies, what do you think? Is there something that stands out to you?

Maria: <reflect>This all sounds interesting, but I’m really not in a rush for insurance right now.</reflect> Honestly, it sounds good naman, but I feel like it's not a priority for me at this point. I need to speak to my family about it rin. 🙆

Agent: I understand, Maria. It’s always important to involve family in such decisions. Can I ask, are you mainly concerned about your current health status or other pressing priorities?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to understand my situation better, I'll give him a bit more context.</reflect> Well, I’m still young and healthy, and I don’t have any dependents kasi... so insurance doesn’t seem so urgent for me. 🙅

Agent: That makes sense. Being young and healthy definitely feels like a luxury. But did you know that getting insurance now can actually be more cost-effective in the long run? Plus, it can give you peace of mind. What do you think about that?

Maria: <reflect>He's mentioning cost-effectiveness, but I'm still not convinced.</reflect> Hmm, that sounds good in theory, but I still feel it’s not urgent. I mean, I’m not married and I don’t have kids. 🤔

Agent: True, you don’t have those responsibilities yet. However, life can be unpredictable, di ba? Sometimes, it’s better to be prepared. Have you considered how it could benefit you even without dependents?

Maria: <reflect>He's making a point, but I am still hesitant.</reflect> I get that, but right now, it’s not on my radar talaga. Maybe I’ll think about it more when I have more obligations. 🙅

Agent: I totally get where you're coming from. Sometimes, it feels better to address these things later. But, did you know that securing a low premium now can actually save you a lot of money when you do have those obligations?

Maria: <reflect>He's emphasizing monetary savings, I need to think this through more.</reflect> Oh, really? I didn’t think about it that way. But, what if my situation changes and I need a different kind of coverage?🙏

Agent: Good question! Our policies are flexible rin naman. You can always adjust your coverage as life changes. Some clients find great comfort in that. 

Maria: <reflect>He’s saying that the policy can adapt to my changing needs.</reflect> Ahhh, gets ko na. Still, I don’t know when I’d really need it, so I think I can wait a bit more. 🙆

Agent: I understand that timing can be tricky. But think about it as an investment for your future self. Have you ever considered how it can also help with financial planning?

Maria: <reflect>He’s trying a different angle now. I should consider this carefully.</reflect> Financial planning is important, and I do save money regularly. But still, it feels like another expense.🤔

Agent: Yes, it might feel that way initially. But having insurance can supplement your savings. It can ensure you don’t dip into those funds in case of unexpected events. Ever thought of it as a safety net?

Maria: <reflect>He's framing it as a financial safeguard.</reflect> A safety net? Hmm, interesting perspective. But, I guess I prioritize saving and investing my money more... 🙆

Agent: That's totally understandable. Saving and investing are definitely smart moves. However, insurance can act like a solid backup plan, complementing your investments. What do you think about integrating both strategies? 

Maria: <reflect>He suggests combining insurance with my current financial strategies.</reflect> That’s a good point. I’ll need some time to mull it over, especially since this isn’t something I planned on. 🙅

Agent: Of course, Maria. It’s always best to take your time with such decisions. If you have any other questions or need more details, I’m here. Would it help to hear about the different flexible plans we offer?

Maria: <reflect>He's offering more details. I should get more info even if I'm not ready to commit.</reflect> Sure, it might be useful to know what my options are. What kind of flexible plans nga ba do you have? 🤔

Agent: We have a range of plans that can suit various life stages and needs. Some are more focused on health, others on long-term savings, and we also have investment-linked policies. Anything in particular you’re curious about?

Maria: <reflect>He's giving me options, I should ask about something that interests me.</reflect> Investment-linked policies? I think I heard about those. How exactly do they work? 🙆
