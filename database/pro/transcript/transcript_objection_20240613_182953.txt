 Agent: Wow, look at the time! We've really covered a lot about FWD's policies. Anything specific that caught your interest, Maria?

Maria: <reflect>Time to share why I'm not interested in insurance</reflect> Well, honestly, I don't believe in insurance. I feel like I'd rather invest the money somewhere else. ðŸ¤”

Agent: I understand where you're coming from, Maria. Investing is great, pero insurance offers financial protection that investments alone might not provide, especially for emergencies. Can I explore this point more with you?

Maria: <reflect>Makes sense, but need to share more concerns</reflect> Hmmm, kasi din I think I'm saving enough sa banko account ko. Why do I need insurance pa?ðŸ˜¡

Agent: Great that you're saving! But let me explain, savings can run out at crucial times. Insurance, on the other hand, ensures you have funds when you need them most, without depleting your savings. It complements your financial plan, not replace it.

Maria: <reflect>Medyo valid point, but I have assets too</reflect> Okay sige, I get that. Pero, I have assets naman like properties. Wonâ€™t they be enough for emergencies? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Owning assets is definitely beneficial. However, turning those assets into immediate cash during emergencies can be time-consuming and sometimes not enough. Insurance provides quick financial relief, so you donâ€™t have to worry about liquidating your assets immediately.

Maria: <reflect>I see his point, but still unsure</reflect> Thatâ€™s a good point, pero parang unnecessary expense it seems. ðŸ¤”

Agent: It can feel that way, lalo na if youâ€™re not familiar with the benefits. Think about it this way: insurance is an investment in peace of mind. It ensures your loved ones wonâ€™t be financially burdened if something unexpected happens to you. Compared to expenses, the value it provides outweighs the cost, especially during critical times.

Maria: <reflect>He's making some strong points, but Iâ€™m concerned about overpaying</reflect> It's just, ayoko ma-overpaying for coverage I donâ€™t need. How can I make sure that doesn't happen? ðŸ™…

Agent: Thatâ€™s a fair concern! We can actually customize your policy based on your specific needs and budget. Hindi kailangan na kumuha ng more than whatâ€™s necessary. At FWD, weâ€™re very flexible on that part!

Maria: <reflect>Customization sounds good, but how flexible really?</reflect> Okay, paano ba nangyayari yun? I'm a bit worried lang kasi.

Agent: We start by assessing your current financial situation, and then we tailor the coverage based on what gaps we identify. This way, you only get what you need, and nothing more. This ensures you are paying for coverage that truly matters to you.

Maria: <reflect>Wow, very specific approach</reflect> Oh, gets ko na. So yun pala yun! I'm liking that approach. 

Agent: Exactly, Maria! And you know, being prepared for any emergency means more than just having savings or assets. Itâ€™s about securing your financial future comprehensively. 

Maria: <reflect>Still both impressed and skeptical about insurance</reflect> Yeah, thatâ€™s right. Hmm... You guys seem very passionate about this.

Agent: Well, it's because weâ€™ve seen firsthand the relief and security it brings to families in tough times. Itâ€™s really fulfilling to help people prepare for the unexpected.

Maria: <reflect>Good to know, but still need a bit more convincing</reflect> That's good to hear. Still, mahirap din to just jump into it. ðŸ¤”

Agent: Totally get it. It's a significant decision after all. We can take it step by step. Maybe we can start with a minimal coverage just to get you comfortable with the idea, tapos you can adjust it as you see fit. What do you think?

Maria: <reflect>Starting small might make it less overwhelming</reflect> Hmm, start minimal, ha. That sounds reasonable. ðŸ‘‹
