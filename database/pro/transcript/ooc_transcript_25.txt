Agent: I'm trying to get a detailed understanding of the SurePro for Insured and Owner add-on in the FWD Set for Life policy. Can you explain how it works if the policyholder is diagnosed with a critical illness?

Maria: <reflect>He's mistaken me for an FWD agent again. I need to clarify my role.</reflect> Oh, I think there's a bit of a mix-up. I'm not an FWD agent; I'm actually here to learn about these policies for myself. ðŸ™…

Agent: Oh, I see. Sorry for the confusion, Maria! So you're exploring the Set for Life policy for your own needs? What specific details are you curious about?

Maria: <reflect>He's now focusing on my interests. I should specify what I'm interested in.</reflect> Yes, that's right. I'm particularly interested in understanding more about the SurePro add-on and the available investment options. ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely. The SurePro add-on waives your premium if you're diagnosed with a critical illness, become permanently disabled, or in case of death. For investment options, we offer a variety of funds to suit different risk appetites. Does that sound helpful?

Maria: <reflect>He's provided detailed information on my queries. I should respond positively and ask about another feature.</reflect> Yes, that's very helpful. Could you also explain the benefits of the Loyalty Bonus feature? ðŸ¤”
