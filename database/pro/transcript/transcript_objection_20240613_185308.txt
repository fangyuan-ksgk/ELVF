 Agent: So, Maria, now that we've discussed all the nitty-gritty details about the insurance policy, what are your thoughts so far?

Maria: <reflect>I should address my concern about being qualified.</reflect>Well, to be honest, I have some concerns. Ano kasi, I smoke and I've heard na hindi yata pwedeng kumuha ng insurance ang smokers. 🙆

Agent: I totally understand your worry, Maria. But don't fret! Actually, many insurance policies nowadays do accommodate smokers. May mga specific terms lang, but it's definitely possible. 

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing the smoking issue; I'll bring up my other concern.</reflect>Okay, that's a relief! Pero, may history rin kasi ako ng sakit sa family. Pwede pa rin ba akong makakuha ng insurance kahit ganon? 🤔

Agent: Great question, Maria. Sa FWD, we assess each case individually. Having a family history of illness doesn't automatically disqualify you. We have comprehensive plans that can fit your situation.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds interesting, but I'll be skeptical for now.</reflect>Oh talaga? Kasi I thought automatic na yun eh. Iba talaga mga naririnig ko. 🙅

Agent: I get where you're coming from, Maria. Marami talagang misconceptions about insurance. That's why it's important to get accurate information from agents like me! 

Maria: <reflect>He's making a good point. I should compare the details.</reflect>I see... Pero what if I compare yung offer niyo sa other insurance companies? Mahirap kasi mag-decide agad-agad. 🙏

Agent: Totally understandable, Maria. It's wise to compare. Pero what sets us apart is our flexibility and customer-centric approach. Have you checked some options with other companies before?

Maria: <reflect>I did check, but I want more reassurance from him.</reflect>Oo, nag-check ako. Pero syempre gusto ko pa rin marinig yung differences from you. 🙆

Agent: Absolutely! One big advantage namin is our personalized service and the wide range of benefits we offer, tailored to your specific needs. Plus, mabilis ang processing time namin.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds good. Let's see what else he has to say.</reflect>Mabilis ang processing time? Hmm, that does sound convenient. How about yung ano, mga loopholes or hidden charges? 🤔

Agent: We don't have any hidden charges, Maria. Transparency is key for us. All details are laid out clearly before you commit to anything. Would you prefer seeing a sample policy?

Maria: <reflect>That could help, but I want to address more concerns first.</reflect>Sure, tingnan ko na nga para clear. Pero wait, paano naman kung may emergency bago pa ma-approve ang policy ko? 😰

Agent: Good question. Once you submit your application and initial payment, we'll provide a temporary coverage, parang interim protection habang inaantay ang approval.

Maria: <reflect>That’s reassuring. Let me think about another objection.</reflect>Okay, I see. E paano yung mga terms and conditions, parang sobrang haba eh. Baka mahirap intindihin? ✋

Agent: I know it can be daunting, Maria. That's why we're here to explain everything line by line, if needed, para sure ka on all aspects of the policy. No stone left unturned.

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing every concern. I'll ask about another detail.</reflect>That sounds thorough. By the way, may na-mention ka kanina about living benefits? Anong ibig sabihin nun exactly? 💬

Agent: Ah, ang living benefits allow you to access part of your policy benefits during your lifetime, like for medical emergencies or critical illness. It’s like a cushion, just in case you need funds before the end term.

Maria: <reflect>This actually sounds advantageous. I'll show some interest.</reflect>Wow, parang ang laking tulong nga yan. Kakaiba yung approach niyo compared sa iba. 🙆

Agent: Exactly, Maria! We put a lot of thought into making sure each customer feels supported. And with the living benefits, you won't have to wait until something drastic happens. Does that sound like something you'd find useful?

Maria: <reflect>He's making a strong case, I'll acknowledge that.</reflect>Yup, very useful! Mas informative talaga when you talk to someone directly. Parang mas madali mag-decide. 🙏

Agent: That’s our goal, to make things as clear and beneficial for you as possible. Any more specific concerns or questions you might have?

Maria: <reflect>I should think of anything else that's bothering me.</reflect>Hmmm, I think nasagot mo naman na most of my worries. I'll definitely consider it. 👍
