 Agent: So Maria, as I mentioned, FWD Insurance offers a lot of benefits, especially for young professionals like you. It's really a good time to consider securing your future. What do you think?

Maria: <reflect>I need to let him know that I'm not in a hurry to decide on this right now.</reflect>Well Alex, to be honest, I feel like I'm still young and healthy. I don't think it's urgent for me to get life insurance at this moment. 🤔

Agent: I understand, Maria. It's common for many young people to think that way. But actually, getting insurance while you're young and healthy affords you better rates and complete protection for any unexpected circumstances. Does that seem more reasonable?

Maria: <reflect>He’s making a good point, but I still need to speak to my family.</reflect>That makes sense, Alex. But I think I need to talk to my family about this first. It’s important to get their opinion too. 🙆

Agent: Definitely, Maria. Discussing it with family is a great step. But just imagine the peace of mind you'd give them knowing you're already protected. It could be a comforting topic to bring up, don't you think?

Maria: <reflect>He's really putting things into perspective, but I still need more time.</reflect>Yeah, I see your point. Pero, life insurance hasn’t been a priority for me. There are a lot of other things I’m focusing on right now.😢

Agent: That's okay, Maria. We all have different priorities. But remember, life insurance can actually provide financial stability for you and your family in the future and might even lighten your financial burdens in the long run. 

Maria: <reflect>Trying to shift my perspective; maybe I should consider this more seriously.</reflect>Hmm, that's interesting. Hindi ko lang iniisip na ganun before. It’s just that now doesn't feel like the best time for this big decision, you know? 🙆

Agent: Totally understandable, Maria. Timing is everything. However, if you think about it, securing a policy now at a younger age means lower premiums compared to five or ten years from now. It’s a small investment for big security.

Maria: <reflect>He’s mentioning financial aspects; maybe this should be a good reason to consider it now.</reflect>Yeah, I guess mas mura if younger. But still, it feels like such a big commitment right now. Maybe next year? 🙏

Agent: I get it, Maria. Many people feel the same way before they realize the importance of it. Maybe you can think about it as a safety net that you’ve already established, freeing up your mind to focus on other things. That might help?

Maria: <reflect>Interesting angle, making it sound like less of a burden.</reflect>Makes sense. Like, it’s there but di ko na need isipin pa. But I'm still pondering about it, honestly. I’m also not supporting anyone with my income.🙆

Agent: Yes, you’re correct, Maria. There's still a personal peace of mind knowing that if anything did happen, your loved ones wouldn’t have to worry about finances. It’s about being prepared for all possibilities.

Maria: <reflect>True, nagbibigay siya ng peace of mind but I'm still hesitant because it seems like a long-term commitment.</reflect>So it’s really more on the preventive side. I do see the value in that. Pero, iba pa rin kasi when you think about long-term commitments. 🤔

Agent: Definitely, it's a long-term commitment. But with FWD, you have options to adjust your policy as your life changes. It’s flexible to cater to different life stages and needs. That should make it a bit easier to consider, right?

Maria: <reflect>He keeps pointing out the benefits and flexibility, which is good.</reflect>Oh, may ganun pala! Then that’s something to think about. Flexibility is a good thing kasi I can adjust depending on my situation. So how do you handle these adjustments? 💬

Agent: Great question, Maria! With FWD, you can easily adjust your coverage or add beneficiaries as you need. Our advisors, like myself, will help you through the entire process any time you need to alter your policy.

Maria: <reflect>He’s making it sound easy and flexible, which I like.</reflect>Oh, that’s nice to know. Parang may additional peace of mind knowing it's adjustable. Pero siyempre, kailangan ko pa rin pag-isipan to. 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Take your time to think it over and discuss it with your family. We’re always here when you’re ready. Just remember, it's about ensuring your peace of mind and financial security.

Maria: <reflect>He's very reassuring, but I still need to think it through.</reflect>Thank you for understanding, Alex. I’ll definitely consider all the points you've shared and talk it over with my family. 🤔
