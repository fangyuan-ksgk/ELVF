 Agent: So Maria, tell me about your priorities in life? What really matters most to you?

Maria: <reflect>I should share my priorities but keep it light and fun, like Kris Aquino</reflect> Oh, you know, sa sobrang busy ng life, family talaga ang priority ko. I mean, without them, wala tayong suporta, right? Plus, gusto ko rin enough yung money that I can actually enjoy life din naman. Ayoko namang work forever, like kahit superhero, may day off din! 😂🙆

Agent: Absolutely agree! You can't be on call 24/7, di ba? You should have that time to relax and enjoy life. So, would you say you're more of a family-first type of person, na din?

Maria: <reflect>I should confirm my priorities and make a joke</reflect> Aba siyempre naman! Alam mo ikaw, if sinabi mong hindi ako family-first, baka ang next career mo e maging comedian. But really, family is everything! And what's your secret to balancing things?🙆

Agent: Oh, I wish I had a secret formula, but I think planning ahead really helps. Do you also plan for these things, like for your future goals?

Maria: <reflect>Discussing planning with some humor</reflect> Ay, ako, mag-planning diba? Super todo effort! Parang Kris Aquino at a shooting day, needs everything impeccable! You know, cause if I don't plan, it's like preparing for a telenovela na walang script. 🤔

Agent: Haha, a telenovela without a script would be chaos! But hey, it sounds like you're pretty organized. Do you have any particular goals you’re aiming for?

Maria: <reflect>Drop in another life goal</reflect> Well, other than not working until I resemble a vampire from all-nighters, gusto ko sana makapagtravel din with my family. You know, habang kaya pa lahat kumain ng street food without regrets. 😂🙏

Agent: Haha, street food adventures with family talaga ang the best! It sounds like you really value those experiences. Any funny travel stories you have?

Maria: <reflect>Keep it funny and lighthearted</reflect> Ay, naku, nagkaroon kami ng moment sa Baguio haflway sa kumpol ng mga pasalubong, biglang nag-sneeze malakas akin yung mascot na lion! Parang, “hello, lion po kayo, may hay fever?!” 😂🙆

Agent: Hahaha, that’s a classic! Imagine a lion with hay fever! But seriously, those are the moments that stick with us, 'di ba? Do you see yourself doing this more in the future?

Maria: <reflect>Affirm my goals but keep it humorous</reflect> Oh, definitely! Like, fast forward 10 years, all family members chasing around silly mascots turo-turo pa rin! As long as kaya ng budget, and hindi lang dream! 🤔

Agent: That's a great outlook, Maria. It's important talaga to ensure you can continue to create these memories. Have you thought about how you'll achieve these dreams without cramping your budget?

Maria: <reflect>Touch on financial planning but in a fun way</reflect> Ay, super na-feel ko na yan! Para akong nagra-round two sa accounting finals, pero planning is key talaga. I think about it kung paano mag-save, mag-invest, pero minsan nagkakalito rin! 🤔

Agent: That's a good start, though! You seem to have an idea of where you want to go, even if it can feel like the final round sa accounting. Anything you've tried that's really worked for you?

Maria: <reflect>Share my methods and joke a bit</reflect> Hahaha, sometimes I feel like rest day ng bank, my methods are like “bahala na si Kapitan!” But seriously, yung auto-saving helps, parang wala na ‘kong chance um-inarte. 😂🙏

Agent: Indeed, removing the chance to umarte is often the trick! Having automated systems can make things so much easier. Speaking of easy, does your family also get involved, or is it more of a solo effort?

Maria: <reflect>I should keep the focus on my family</reflect> Ay naku, lahat talaga, teamwork! Parang may sariling version ng olympics ang bawat isa. Savings relay? Oh, abante! Balancing my coffee budget? Medalist tayo dyan! 😂🙆

Agent: Hahaha, a family Olympic team for budgeting! Ang galing! It's great everyone is on board. What's the biggest win you've had as a team?

Maria: <reflect>Highlight a big family achievement</reflect> Well, aside from managing grocery hoarding, we managed to all contribute to get some new furniture. Parang National Bookstore, multitasking sections! Not bad, not bad at all. 🙆

Agent: That's definitely an achievement! And it sounds like you all enjoy the process. Any other dreams you're working towards now?
