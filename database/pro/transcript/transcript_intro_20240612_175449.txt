Agent: So Maria, do you mind if I ask you a bit about your financial goals and aspirations? This will really help me tailor our discussion to your needs.

Maria: <reflect>He's moving on to talk about finances. I guess it's important for the insurance talk.</reflect>Oh, ayan na, serious na tayo. Well, I'm aiming to save enough for my future children's education and maybe a small business someday. How about you, do you have experience helping people with similar goals? 🙆

Agent: Absolutely, we help clients with various goals, from education funding to setting up businesses. And speaking of dreams, you're also securing a safety net for unexpected events. Have you ever thought about what would happen to your plans if something went wrong?

Maria: <reflect>He’s making a good point; I need to think about the worst-case scenario.</reflect>Oh my gosh, ang dami naman 'yan! But yeah, I’ve thought about it a bit. I just never knew where to start. 🙅

Agent: That's where we come in. At FWD, we have comprehensive plans that not only help with savings but also protect against life’s uncertainties. What would you say is your biggest concern regarding your finances right now?

Maria: <reflect>Ok, straight to the point. What's my biggest financial worry?</reflect>Siguro my biggest concern would be unexpected medical bills. I mean, hospitals can get really expensive, right?

Agent: Exactly, medical emergencies can drain savings pretty quickly. Our health insurance plans can cover those major expenses without derailing your dreams. Do you currently have any health insurance?

Maria: <reflect>I have some coverage but not much detail about it.</reflect>Meron, but I don't think it's comprehensive enough. Parang kulang sa coverage? 🤔

Agent: I hear you. Sometimes basic health plans don’t cover the big stuff. We have policies that can fill those gaps, ensuring you're well-protected without financial strain. Have you ever reviewed your current coverage to see where the gaps might be?

Maria: <reflect>Time to check my current plan thoroughly, I guess.</reflect>Haven't done a thorough review in ages. Maybe it's high time I looked into it more seriously, huh? 🙆

Agent: A review would be a great step. We can actually help you analyze your current plan and highlight areas that might need more coverage. That way, you can have peace of mind knowing nothing's left to chance. What do you think about that?

Maria: <reflect>Seems helpful, should consider it.</reflect>Sounds like a lifesaver! Am I supposed to bring any documents for the review? 💬

Agent: Yes, if you could bring any current policy documents and some details about your financial status, it would be super helpful. We can then tailor our recommendations specifically for you. Any other areas of your life you think could benefit from additional coverage?

Maria: <reflect>Let's see, what else is there?</reflect>Well, my parents are getting older din. Would there be something to help with their needs too? 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, we have plans designed for eldercare, ensuring they receive the medical attention they need without placing a burden on you financially. It's really about protecting the people you love.

Maria: <reflect>This is touching on an important point for me...</reflect>That's reassuring to hear. I’d hate to be caught unprepared pagdating sa parents ko.

Agent: Our goal is to ensure you're prepared for all aspects of life, not just for yourself but also for your loved ones. So when you're ready, we can set up a meeting to go over everything in detail. Does that sound good?

Maria: <reflect>He's really making sure I'm considering all bases covered financially.</reflect>Yeah, that sounds like a solid plan. Eto na 'to, mature decision-making na ako! 🙆

Agent: You're making great strides, Maria! It's all about making informed decisions now to secure a better future. While we're on the topic, do you have a preference for short-term or long-term policies?

Maria: <reflect>Need to decide between short and long-term.</reflect>Honestly? Both sound good depending on the context. Parang, why not have a mix? 🤔

Agent: That's a wise approach. A mix helps balance immediate needs with future goals. We can create a customized portfolio for you that addresses both. Any other specific concerns you want to discuss?

Maria: <reflect>He's really thorough, alright...</reflect>Well, maybe just understanding all these financial terms more clearly. Sometimes it feels like I'm lost in a sea of jargon. 🙆

Agent: I totally understand. We strive to make everything as clear and jargon-free as possible. Education is key, and we’ll make sure you fully understand your options before making any commitments. Feel free to ask me anything at any time.
