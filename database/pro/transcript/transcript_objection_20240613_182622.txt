 Agent: So Maria, I've shared with you the details of the policy and its benefits. What do you think?

Maria: <reflect>Time to share my concerns and see how he responds.</reflect>Hmm, well Alex, to be honest, I just feel like it's better to save the money in the bank para naman you'll earn interest, di ba?🤔

Agent: I understand where you're coming from, Maria. Saving in the bank is important, but life insurance offers more protection and can actually complement your savings. Have you considered how fast medical costs can rise, and how getting insured can protect those savings?

Maria: <reflect>He made a good point, but I still need to dig deeper.</reflect>True, pero my partner already has life insurance and I'm thinking baka redundant na if I get one too? 🙅

Agent: That’s a valid concern, Maria. Think of it this way - having your own life insurance gives you personal coverage tailored to your needs. And having both partners insured provides double security, ensuring that your finances remain stable no matter what happens.

Maria: <reflect>Alright, he makes sense, but I'm not entirely convinced yet.</reflect>Hmm, pero kasi I'm thinking nako, I already am healthy naman so parang unnecessary expense sa akin.🙅

Agent: I get that, Maria. You seem very health-conscious! But life insurance isn't just about immediate health; it's about long-term planning. What if something unexpected happens? Having insurance is like having a safety net so you don't disrupt your plans.

Maria: <reflect>He’s really trying but I still need something more concrete.</reflect>Okay, pero ayoko rin to overpay for coverage I don't need. It’s a big commitment eh. 🤔

Agent: That’s a fair concern, Maria. The good thing about FWD is we have customizable plans. You only get and pay for the coverage that suits your specific needs, kaya hindi ka mag-o-overpay.

Maria: <reflect>Sige, the customizable plans sound reasonable. Let's see.</reflect>Interesting, but I still think that investing the money might be more beneficial long-term, right? 🙆

Agent: Investing is great for wealth growth, I agree. But life insurance provides security that investments can't offer alone, like guaranteed payouts and coverage for unexpected events. It’s about having a diversified financial strategy.

Maria: <reflect>He’s making good points. Maybe I should ask more about how it integrates with investments.</reflect>Okay, I see your point. So, how does this fit with my current investments? How does it balance everything out?

Agent: Great question, Maria. Life insurance can actually complement your investments by providing a protective layer. You'll have your investments growing, while life insurance ensures that your family won’t have to worry about finances if something happens to you. It provides balance and peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>That makes sense. He's thinking broadly about financial health.</reflect>Alright, I get what you mean. But isn't having HMO coverage enough for medical emergencies? Why do I need this insurance?

Agent: HMOs are fantastic for short-term healthcare needs, but they usually don't cover all the long-term costs or provide financial support for your family in case of unexpected events. Life insurance fills that gap by offering additional financial protection.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, he's giving clear distinctions between HMO and life insurance.</reflect>I see, klaro, so it's more for long-term and bigger picture scenarios. 🙆

Agent: Exactly, Maria. It’s about preparing comprehensively for the future. It’s great that you're already thinking about all these aspects of financial health.

Maria: <reflect>Starting to lean towards the idea but still have some reservations.</reflect>You've covered a lot, Alex. I admit it's making more sense now. Pero, do I need to start with a big plan immediately? Or can I start small?

Agent: You have the flexibility to start small and adjust your plan as your needs evolve. We can tailor it to fit your current financial situation and gradually enhance it as you see fit.

Maria: <reflect>He’s really accommodating, which is good.</reflect>Okay, that sounds more manageable. So, parang I can grow the policy with my needs? 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. The goal is to have a plan that's both flexible and sustainable for you. We always aim to provide value that grows with you.

Maria: <reflect>Nice, he's really hitting the right points.</reflect>Okay, I'll think about it, Alex. Thanks for all the info and for adjusting to my needs. This has been really helpful. 🙌

Agent: I’m glad to help, Maria! Feel free to ask if you have more questions or need any clarifications. I’m just here to assist you in any way I can.

Maria: <reflect>I might take him up on that.</reflect>Will do. Thanks again, Alex. This has definitely given me a lot to consider.😅
