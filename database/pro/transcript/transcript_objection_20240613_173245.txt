 Agent: So, Maria, that's pretty much the gist of what FWD has to offer. How are you finding it so far? Any thoughts?

Maria: <reflect>I'm not quite sure if I trust FWD yet. There are a few things I need to clarify.</reflect>Well, it's all very interesting, but I do have some concerns. First, FWD is quite new, right? I haven't heard much about it before. 🤔

Agent: Ah, I understand your concern, Maria. FWD has been around in the Philippines since 2014, and even though it's relatively new, we’ve been expanding quite rapidly across Asia. We’re backed by Pacific Century Group, which has strong financial roots. Does that help clarify things a bit?

Maria: <reflect>Okay, so they're growing, but still...🤔</reflect>Yes, that makes sense, but still, I'd rather buy from someone I already know. What assurance can you give me, personally? 🙅

Agent: Definitely. Building trust is crucial. To assure you, I’m dedicated to being your partner every step of the way. You won't just get the company's reliability but also my personal attention to your needs. Also, FWD offers 24/7 customer support, ensuring you can always reach someone if anything comes up.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, customer service sounds decent, but there's another thing.🤔</reflect>Okay, but I've heard about insurance companies increasing premiums without clear reasons. How does FWD handle that? 🙆

Agent: That’s a valid concern. At FWD, we believe in transparency. Our policies are designed to be straightforward, and any changes in premiums are communicated well in advance with clear explanations. We also have options for fixed premiums for certain policies, so you won’t get any surprises.

Maria: <reflect>Good, they've addressed my main concerns, but I'm still cautious.🙆</reflect>Alright, that’s somewhat reassuring. But what if I need to adjust my policy later on? Is that possible with FWD? 🧐

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Flexibility is one of our key features. If your circumstances change, you can adjust your policy accordingly. Whether you need to modify your coverage or add benefits, we’ll work with you to ensure your policy suits your evolving needs.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, flexibility is good. Still, I'm a bit skeptical.🙅</reflect>Okay, I appreciate the flexibility. But you know, saving money is also very important to me. Insurance feels like an additional expense.💬

Agent: I get that, saving money is really important. Think of insurance as a safety net. It’s about protecting what you’ve worked hard for and ensuring that an unforeseen event doesn’t deplete your savings. In fact, some policies allow for accumulated savings, giving you returns in the long run.

Maria: <reflect>Still, my focus is on getting the most value out of my money upfront.🙆</reflect>I see, But isn't it better to save the money in the bank to earn interest? 👍

Agent: True, bank savings do earn interest, but insurance offers a different kind of benefit. Apart from savings, you get protection and risk coverage. There are also investment-linked insurance products that give you the dual advantage of earning returns while being insured.

Maria: <reflect>Dual advantage does sound appealing, though I still need to be convinced.💬</reflect>Alright, investment-linked products do sound a bit more appealing. But tell me, why FWD over other insurance providers? 💬

Agent: Great question! FWD's approach is unique. We focus on making insurance simpler, more accessible, and engaging for our clients. Plus, our quick and easy claims process sets us apart. We aim to provide a hassle-free experience. Since you value ease and efficiency, I think you’ll appreciate that. Does that address your concern?

Maria: <reflect>He’s making a good point, but I'm still cautious.💬</reflect>It does make sense, but I heard from others about premium increases without clear reason from insurance companies. How does FWD handle this? 🤔

Agent: That's a common concern, but at FWD, transparency is key. Any changes in premiums are always communicated with a clear explanation. We also offer certain policies with fixed premiums, so you won’t face unexpected hikes. 

Maria: <reflect>He's already covered a lot, but I still need assurance.🙆</reflect>I guess that makes sense. One last thing—I’d rather know more about you and why you chose FWD. 🙋
