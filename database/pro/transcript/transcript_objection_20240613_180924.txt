 Agent: I'm so glad we had the chance to go over everything, Maria. So, what do you think about the policy? 

Maria: <reflect>I need to address my financial concerns. Three main points come to mind, starting with my salary.</reflect> You know, the policy sounds really good, but honestly, my salary is not enough to spend on insurance right now. 🙅

Agent: I understand where you're coming from, Maria. But did you know we have flexible payment options that can fit into various budgets? We can tailor something based on what you can afford.

Maria: <reflect>It's good to know there are flexible options, but I have other financial burdens too.</reflect> Well, yun nga eh, I'm still paying off my loan, and I'm really tight on my budget because of that. 🤔

Agent: I get it, loans can really limit what you can set aside. Another approach is paying a lower premium while you're still paying off your loan, then increasing it once you're more financially free. It’s like customizing your plan based on your current situation.

Maria: <reflect>That flexibility sounds interesting, but I still need to address my overall income issue.</reflect> Ang ganda nyan, but I just don't have a steady income right now, kasi freelancing is so unpredictable. 🙏

Agent: Freelancing can be tricky, that's for sure. Our plans can accommodate fluctuating incomes too. Plus, having insurance can actually give you more security, knowing that you have something to fall back on during lean months.

Maria: <reflect>I appreciate that he's addressing my concerns one by one, but I still need more reassurance.</reflect>I like how you’re addressing my financial concerns, but have you ever had similar clients who faced the same issues? 💬

Agent: Absolutely, many of my clients are freelancers and small business owners with irregular incomes. They find that having insurance provides them peace of mind and a safety net—especially given the unpredictable nature of their work.

Maria: <reflect>It's nice to know he's experienced with similar clients. I should ask about any success stories.</reflect> That’s comforting. Could you share a success story about one of them? 🙏

Agent: Sure, I had a client who was a freelance artist. He was in similar shoes—tight budget, erratic income. We set up a very affordable plan for him, and he was actually able to use it when he met an unexpected health crisis. It saved him a lot of financial stress.

Maria: <reflect>That story is quite convincing. I should consider his points on financial stress relief.</reflect> Nakaka-relieve naman pakinggan na he was able to use his plan effectively. I guess having insurance din has its long-term benefits. 🙆

Agent: Exactly, Maria. It's really about turning unpredictable situations into manageable ones. You also get that added peace of mind, knowing you're covered. 

Maria: <reflect>He's done well in explaining, but I still worry about overpaying for coverage I might not need.</reflect> That makes sense. My only other concern talaga is not wanting to overpay for coverage na I don’t need. 🙅

Agent: That’s a valid concern. We can mix and match our policy options so you're only paying for what you actually need. We also review the policy annually to make sure it’s still the best fit for you.

Maria: <reflect>He's been quite thorough and understanding. I should acknowledge that and think about this some more.</reflect> I have to say, you've been really thorough and understanding with all my concerns. I'll definitely have to think about this. 🙏

Agent: I appreciate that, Maria. It's important for me that clients feel secure and well-informed. If you have any more questions or need time to consider, I'm here. 

Maria: <reflect>He’s leaving the door open for more questions, which is nice. I'll just keep this friendly.</reflect>Thanks, I really appreciate that. I might have more questions once I go over everything in my head. 🙆

Agent: Absolutely, take your time, and feel free to reach out anytime. By the way, have you ever heard about our financial literacy workshops? They’re really helpful! 

Maria: <reflect>That sounds interesting.</reflect> Financial literacy workshops? Interesting! What do you cover in those? 💬
