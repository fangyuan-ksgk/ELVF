 Agent: I understand, Maria, maraming salamat talaga for listening. So what do you think of our life insurance products so far?

Maria: <reflect>Okay, I'll start with some trust issues I've heard about.</reflect>Ay Alex, it sounds really interesting. Pero, I have a few concerns... You mentioned FWD, but what is FWD? I mean, it's a new company, right? 🤔

Agent: I totally get where you're coming from, Maria. Actually, FWD started back in 2013 and it's part of the Pacific Century Group. We're relatively new in the Philippines pero very established na in other parts of Asia like Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Thailand. We've been growing really fast kasi we're focused on customer experience and innovation.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, he seems confident. But can they really be trusted?</reflect>Hmmm, interesting. But, I haven't really heard much about FWD before. Is it okay to trust a company that's not yet as famous as others? 💬

Agent: Good question, Maria. While it's true na we're newer dito sa Philippines, in the few years we've been around, we've secured partnerships with established financial institutions like Security Bank. Plus, we have good financial ratings and feedback from our customers, which is very important for building trust.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds reasonable enough. But there's another issue.</reflect>One more thing, Alex. I've heard some stories about insurance companies increasing premiums without any clear reason. I'm a bit worried about that. 🤔

Agent: Understandable, Maria. At FWD, transparency is a key principle. We make sure na lahat ng policyholders are informed about how and why premiums might change. It's all written kasi in clear terms in the policy documents. We really prioritize being transparent to maintain our clients' trust.

Maria: <reflect>At least they seem to have a structure in place. But what if I need adjustments?</reflect>Okay, that's helpful to know. But, what if I need to adjust my policy later on? Baka things change in the future, diba? 🙆‍♀️

Agent: Great point, Maria. Flexibility is another principle we uphold. We offer options to adjust your coverage to suit your changing needs and lifestyle. Whether it's adding more coverage or adjusting payment terms, may options tayo that fit your needs.

Maria: <reflect>That's reassuring to hear. Now I need to know more about the benefits.</reflect>That's good to hear. So, tell me naman, what are the standout benefits of choosing FWD over other companies? 🙌

Agent: Sure! One of the biggest benefits is our comprehensive coverage options that cater to different life stages and needs. Plus, we prioritize digitalization, so you can manage your policy online anytime, anywhere. And our claims process is one of the fastest in the industry.

Maria: <reflect>Sounds convincing, pero I'll dig a bit deeper.</reflect>Wow, that sounds techy! Pero yung claims process na fast, how fast are we talking about? 💬

Agent: We've had claims processed in as fast as 48 hours, Maria. It really depends on the complexity of the claim, but we strive to make it as quick and hassle-free as possible for our clients.

Maria: <reflect>Impressive. I think I'm starting to like what I hear.</reflect>Quick claims sound really good, especially in emergencies. How about customer service? Is it easy to reach you guys kung may problems? 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Our customer service is available 24/7, kaya you can reach us anytime through different channels like phone, email, or even chat on our website. Customer satisfaction is something we take very seriously. 

Maria: <reflect> Okay, that's a big relief... Let's see...</reflect> That’s a big relief. And can my family get the same benefits too? I'm thinking long-term kasi.🙌

Agent: Yes, definitely! We have family plans that provide coverage for each member, so everyone is protected. And we even offer discounts for bundled plans, para mas makasave ka. Your family’s future is very important to us too.

Maria: <reflect>Interesting, he's addressing most of my concerns..</reflect>That’s really good to know, Alex. Can I also view my policy details online? What if I misplace important documents? 😅

Agent: No worries there, Maria. We have an online portal where you can access all your policy details anytime. So kahit you misplace your documents, you can easily download copies or view them online.

Maria: <reflect>This is becoming reassuring, but I'll keep him talking. More details are better!</reflect>Ah that's convenient! How about if there are any major changes in the policy? Will I be notified immediately? 🤔

Agent: Yes, Maria. Any major changes in your policy will be communicated to you immediately through multiple channels like email or SMS—whichever you prefer. We make sure you're always in the loop.

Maria: <reflect> Sounds satisfying, but one last thing... My friend experienced a different treatment after he signed up .</reflect> One last thing, Alex. A friend of mine said his agent didn't follow up with him after he signed up. What's your take on this? 🙆‍♀️
