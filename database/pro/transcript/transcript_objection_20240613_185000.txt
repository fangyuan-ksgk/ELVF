 Agent: Hi Maria, kamusta? Finally, nice to meet you. I've discussed the details of our insurance policies and I hope you find them interesting. Meron po ba kayong mga questions or concerns about our offerings? 🙂

Maria: <reflect>Ang funny naman ni Alex kanina, pero alanganin ako sa pagiging qualified ko.</reflect> Alam mo Alex, ang ganda ng mga features niyo ha. Pero, I don't think I am allowed to get life insurance kasi I smoke. Address issue with agent. 😕

Agent: Ah, I see. Don't worry, Maria. Having a smoking habit doesn't disqualify you from getting life insurance. We actually have policies na tailored to those who smoke. The premiums might be a bit higher lang compared to non-smokers, but you’re definitely still eligible. 😊

Maria: <reflect>Mukhang okay naman yun. Pero, may isa pa akong concern.</reflect> Okay, that's good to know. Pero I have a history of illness din kasi. Hindi ba ako disqualified dahil dun?

Agent: Good question, Maria. It really depends on the type of illness and its severity. Most insurance companies will require you to undergo a medical examination or provide your medical history before approving your policy. Pero, many get approved pa rin with pre-existing conditions. We can find a policy that suits your needs. 😊

Maria: <reflect>Sana nga may suitable policy for me.</reflect> Salamat sa pag-explain, Alex. Pero parang andami ko naman kailangan i-disclose. Isn't it tedious?

Agent: I understand it sounds a bit overwhelming, Maria. There is some paperwork involved, especially with medical questions. But it's all for ensuring you get the best coverage. We make it as smooth as possible for our clients. Plus, you won't have to handle it alone; I'll help you through the entire process. 😊

Maria: <reflect>Mukhang okay yung support ni Alex. Pero baka may ibang benefits na iniisip ko pa.</reflect> That's reassuring, Alex. Ano pang ibang benefits ang pwedeng makuha sa policy na ito?

Agent: Aside from the financial security for your loved ones, our life insurance policies also offer benefits like critical illness coverage, accidental death coverage, and even the option to build cash value over time. Some policies also come with investment components. 😊

Maria: <reflect>Ang dami palang perks. Pero parang andami ko na nga iniisip.</reflect> Wow, ang dami palang benefits. Pero sa totoo lang, di ko pa talaga sure kung ready ako to take on a policy with all these considerations.

Agent: That's completely understandable, Maria. It's a big decision and it takes time to weigh all the factors. We'll take it step by step. Maybe we can also discuss more about your specific needs and what you hope to achieve with this insurance. 😊

Maria: <reflect>Mukhang gusto ni Alex na mag-usap pa kami tungkol dito. Sige, I'll give it a thought muna.</reflect> I appreciate that you're willing to guide me, Alex. I think kailangan ko munang pag-isipan ng mabuti.

Agent: Of course, Maria. Take your time. We can always revisit this discussion kapag ready ka na. If you have any more questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out. 😊

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, I should clear my last concerns about eligibility and the whole process.</reflect> Salamat, Alex! Before we wrap up, may iba pa bang conditions na pwedeng maka-affect sa eligibility ko?

Agent: Generally, aside from smoking and pre-existing illnesses, age and lifestyle can also affect eligibility and premiums. Yung ibang policies may cap on maximum age limit during application. But remember, there are always options and solutions available depending on each individual’s situation. 😊

Maria: <reflect>Maka-explore pa nga ng more details ng policies nila.</reflect> Thanks for clarifying that. Mukhang need ko pa talaga i-review lahat ng options. May materials ka ba na pwedeng ibigay to read more about these policies?

Agent: Absolutely, Maria! I have brochures and digital resources that I can send you right after this meeting. They’re very detailed and will give you more insight on our different plans. 😊

Maria: <reflect>Perfect yon, may time pa ako magbasa-basa.</reflect> That would be great, Alex. Big help talaga yan so I can review everything at my own pace. Sige, I'll wait for those materials.

Agent: Sure thing, Maria. Expect those materials in your inbox shortly. If may questions ka from reading those, you can reach out anytime. 😊

Maria: <reflect>That's convenient. Sige, I'll talk to him if may questions nga ako.</reflect> Thanks, I'll go through them and let you know if may questions ako, Alex. Salamat sa patience and help! 🙏
