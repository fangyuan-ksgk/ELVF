 Agent: So Maria, we've discussed the various benefits and features of our insurance policies. I am confident these would provide great security for you and your family.

Maria: <reflect>I should address my concerns here.</reflect> Honestly, I don't think I am allowed to get life insurance because I smoke. I've heard that's a big no-no for insurance companies. ðŸ™†

Agent: That's a common concern, Maria. Smoking does have an impact on premiums, but it doesn't disqualify you from getting coverage. Many of our clients who smoke have successfully secured policies. The key is to be upfront about it.

Maria: <reflect>I'm still skeptical about this smoking thing.</reflect>Really? But won't my premiums be sky high because of it? ðŸ™†

Agent: It might be a bit higher than non-smokers, yes. But the good news is, even with the higher premium, it still provides significant financial security. And, should you decide to quit smoking later on, we can potentially lower your premiums after a few years.

Maria: <reflect>That's actually kinda reassuring. Should bring up another concern.</reflect>Oh, I see. But what if I have a history of illness? Like, would that also affect my chances of getting insured? ðŸ™†

Agent: That's a valid point, Maria. A history of illness can affect the underwriting process, but it doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t get coverage. We have various policies that cater to different health conditions, and we can find one that suits your needs.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, that's a bit comforting; I'll dig a little deeper into this.</reflect>So how does FWD handle cases like mine? Is there a strict process for those with medical histories? ðŸ™†

Agent: Yes, there is a process, but it's designed to be as transparent and supportive as possible. We might need some additional medical examinations or reports, but our goal is to offer you the best possible coverage given your circumstances.

Maria: <reflect>That's fair enough. But shouldn't I be worried about the cost then? Such evaluations might end up being expensive!</reflect>And these additional medical requirements, don't they add up to the cost as well? ðŸ™†

Agent: We try to absorb most of the costs associated with medical evaluations. Our main objective is to make sure you're insurable and can have peace of mind regarding your coverage.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds a bit more reasonable. But I still feel hesitant.</reflect>I guess that's a bit more manageable then. Still, it feels like so much hassle! ðŸ™†

Agent: I understand, Maria. The process might seem daunting, but our team will be with you every step of the way. Once everything is in place, you won't have to worry about it again.

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s really trying to make this sound simple. I should ask one more thing.</reflect>Alright. One last thing - what if something unpredictable happens while I'm still under review? Like, is there any interim coverage? ðŸ™†

Agent: Thatâ€™s a great question. During the underwriting process, you might be eligible for a temporary coverage, providing some financial protection while your application is being reviewed.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, so I still get coverage during the waiting period. Not bad at all.</reflect>Oh, that's interesting. How would I know if I qualify for that temporary coverage? ðŸ™†

Agent: We'll inform you right away once you submit all the necessary documents. Our priority is to ensure you're protected as soon as possible.

Maria: <reflect>That does make it a bit more convenient. One more thing comes to mind.</reflect>Oh, I see. What about exclusions? Anything I should know about that could affect my claim one way or another? ðŸ™†

Agent: There are typical exclusions like pre-existing conditions, certain hazardous activities, and circumstances involving fraud. But we'll go through all the policy details to ensure youâ€™re well informed before making any decisions.

Maria: <reflect>That actually answered a lot! Feeling more informed now.</reflect>Thanks for explaining all that. Itâ€™s a lot to take in! ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely, it is. But rest assured, I'll be here to guide you. Any other concerns you'd like to address today?

Maria: <reflect>Maybe now's a good time to think about what's been discussed.</reflect>Hmm, I think we've covered most of my concerns for now. I'm going to need some time to process all this information. ðŸ™†

Agent: Thatâ€™s perfectly fine, Maria. Take all the time you need. If you have any more questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out. Our goal is to make sure you feel comfortable and confident in your decision.

Maria: <reflect>He's being considerate. I appreciate the patience.</reflect>Thank you, I really appreciate your patience and thorough explanations. This is definitely something to consider seriously. ðŸ™†
