 Agent: So, Maria, now that we've established we're both traffic survivors, letâ€™s talk about what really matters to you. What are your top priorities in life?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking about my priorities and seems genuine about knowing me better.</reflect>Well, to be honest, family is super important to me. Laging sila yung nasa isip ko. Also, I want to make sure I have enough savings. I mean, who wants to work forever, right? ðŸ˜‚

Agent: Hahaha, yes, we could be EDSA traffic performers forever! So, family first, that's great to hear. Do you have any particular goals you'd like to achieve for your family?

Maria: <reflect>He wants to know more about my family-related goals, maybe I should share a bit.</reflect>Actually, I just want to make sure they're comfortable and secure. Yung tipong, hindi na kailangan mag-worry about gastos and stuff. How about you? Do you have any big life goals?ðŸ¤”

Agent: For sure, itâ€™s all about making life easier, diba? As for me, I think reaching financial freedom would make me dance in the office! Speaking of which, you mentioned savings, what are you currently doing to build those?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to see how I handle my savings; I should give him an idea.</reflect>I try to save a bit from each paycheck, and sometimes I invest in small stuff like maybe trying to win from overpricing lemon and avocado seeds! Hahaha! ðŸ˜‚ Do you think I'm missing out?

Agent: Haha, well, I'm not sure about avocados, but it's definitely a start! It's important naman to have a strategy. Anything else youâ€™re eyeing to put your savings into?

Maria: <reflect>He's curious if I have more plans for my savings, I should share honestly.</reflect>Not really, Iâ€™m still exploring my options. Maybe you could share some good ideas for someone who loves spending on halo-halo? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Halo-halo, the true Filipino classic! Well, it's good to treat yourself. Have you ever thought about long-term investments, like maybe real estate or business?

Maria: <reflect>He's giving me ideas about investments; I should show interest without committing immediately.</reflect>Oh, real estate sounds like a big step. Parang exciting din, pero challenging at the same time. What kind of business would you suggest for someone who can't resist online shopping? ðŸ˜‚

Agent: Haha, online shopping pa lang, you might have a great e-commerce potential there! But kidding aside, any hobbies or skills youâ€™re really good at that might turn into a business?

Maria: <reflect>He's encouraging me to think about a business; I should share a hobby I enjoy.</reflect>Well, I do love baking, especially during weekends. Pag stress ka na from work, bake na lang! Palagay mo, baking business pwede? ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely! Who can resist freshly baked goods, right? Plus, it's therapeutic. Have you ever sold your baked goodies before or is it just for family and friends?

Maria: <reflect>He's showing genuine interest in my baking skills; I can explain further.</reflect>Mostly just for family and friends. They keep telling me to sell them, but iba yung pressure kapag business na, diba? ðŸ™†

Agent: True, there is pressure. But I'm sure your family and friends wouldn't steer you wrong. So aside from savings and maybe diving into a baking business, what else do you hope to achieve before hitting ultimate retirement mode? ðŸ˜„

Maria: <reflect>He wants to know more about my goals before retirement, I'll think bigger.</reflect>I guess traveling the world is one! Kasi naman, who doesn't want to explore new places while you're still energetic right? ðŸ‘‹

Agent: Oh yes, traveling! Gusto ko rin yan! We could probably avoid heavy traffic in different countries, haha! Any dream destinations?

Maria: <reflect>He's interested in my travel goals; I can share my top destinations.</reflect>Europe ang top of my list! The culture, history, food, grabe! How about you? If not selling insurance, what do you dream of doing? ðŸ™Œ

Agent: Europe sounds fantastic! As for me, maybe becoming a stand-up comedian sa Makati traffic? Okay, maybe not, but I love exploring new career adventures too. So when you think about your retirement fund, what are the thoughts running through your mind?

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s bringing the conversation back to retirement; I should share my thoughts there.</reflect>I think more about how to make sure it's enough. Ayoko naman maging one of those people na still working well into their senior years. Doesn't sound fun! ðŸ™…

Agent: Definitely not fun. Everyone deserves a good rest after years of hard work. Any steps youâ€™ve been thinking of taking to prepare for that?

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s asking about my preparation for retirement; I'll talk about the basics.</reflect>Well, aside from savings, Iâ€™m exploring retirement plans but donâ€™t really know much about them. Any recommendations?ðŸ¤”

Agent: Lots of good options out there! It's really about finding the right match for your goals. Sounds like you've got a lot of great priorities lined up, Maria!
