 Agent: I'm glad nakapag-usap tayo ng ganito, Maria. So, after hearing about all the product details ng FWD Insurance, what are your thoughts so far?

Maria: <reflect>I should mention my concerns about trust first.</reflect>Well, Alex, to be honest, I prefer to do my research first kasi it's hard to trust someone agad when it comes to financial decisions like this. ðŸ™†

Agent: That's completely understandable, Maria. Actually, doing your own research is really important. We encourage clients to do that. Maybe I can provide you some resources to check out so you feel more comfortable?

Maria: <reflect>He's offering resources, this could be helpful but I still have concerns about trust.</reflect>That sounds good, but I'm also thinking na I might find better insurance options elsewhere. ðŸ™†

Agent: I get where you're coming from. There are many options talaga out there. What sets FWD apart though is our customer service and the transparency in our policies. We make sure every client understands what theyâ€™re getting into without any surprises.

Maria: <reflect>He's emphasizing transparency, but I'm still doubtful.</reflect>I see. Pero siyempre, it feels safer din kasi to buy from someone I know personally. That's another hurdle for me. ðŸ™†

Agent: Kaya nga, Maria. Trust is built over time talaga. While we might not know each other personally pa, I can assure you that FWD has built a reputation on trust and reliability. You can even ask for testimonials from other clients if that helps.

Maria: <reflect>Testimonials might help, but I'm not fully convinced yet.</reflect>Testimonials could help, sure. Pero ang hirap lang talaga mag-decide right away, lalo na with all these options. ðŸ™…

Agent: It's a big decision, Maria. I really appreciate how you're thinking this through. Alam mo, sometimes it helps to have a pros and cons list when making decisions like this. Have you tried that method before?

Maria: <reflect>He's suggesting a decision-making tool, which might be useful.</reflect>Oh, that's a good idea. Pero siyempre, sa dami ng pros and cons, I might still end up confused. ðŸ™†

Agent: That's true, analysis paralysis. Let me simplify it for you then. Imagine, ano'ng mangyayari if you suddenly needed big medical expenses or if something unexpected happens? Would you and your family be prepared without insurance?

Maria: <reflect>He's making a valid point about unexpected events.</reflect>That's a fair point, Alex. Insurance can be a safety net, I understand that. But knowing which policy is best is still a challenge. ðŸ™†

Agent: Yes, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here to help you find the right fit for your needs. It's not about getting the most expensive policy; it's about getting the most suitable one. What are your main priorities when it comes to insurance?

Maria: <reflect>I should discuss my priorities so he can tailor the information better.</reflect>Well, main priority ko talaga is health coverage and yung hindi masakit sa bulsa. Then, anything else is secondary. ðŸ™†

Agent: Got it, health coverage that's affordable and reliable. Good news, Maria. We have plans specifically tailored for that. Let me ask, do you value more yung critical illness coverage or mas focus ka sa daily health expenses?

Maria: <reflect>He's narrowing it down to specifics, I should answer directly.</reflect>Definitely, critical illness coverage. Kasi malaking gastos yun if ever. ðŸ™†

Agent: Perfect, we have critical illness riders that can be added to your policy. What if I show you some case studies of clients na in similar situations as yours? Maybe that can give you a clearer picture.

Maria: <reflect>Case studies might be helpful to see real-life situations.</reflect>Okay, case studies sound helpful. And do these plans allow flexibility to adjust later on? ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely! Flexibility is one of the key features of our policies. You can adjust based on changing needs and circumstances. Isn't that something you'll value in the long run?

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility is definitely an important factor.</reflect>Yeah, flexibility is a big plus. Itâ€™s just overwhelming to think about right now. ðŸ™†

Agent: I hear you, Maria. It's overwhelming to make any big decisions. If you have any more questions or kailangan mo ng more time to think, that's totally fine. Should we go over the case studies para medyo may clarity na?
