 Agent: So Maria, after discussing all the details, what are your thoughts on getting this insurance policy?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking for my thoughts, I should mention my financial concerns.</reflect>Well, Alex, the thing is, salary ko ngayon is not enough to spend on insurance. I'm worried na baka mahirapan ako financially if I commit to this. 🙅

Agent: I totally understand, Maria. Budget is always a major concern. Did you know that FWD offers flexible plans? You can start with a lower premium and adjust it as your financial situation improves. How does that sound?

Maria: <reflect>He's suggesting flexible plans, but I'm still concerned about my income.</reflect>That's interesting, pero there's another issue. Wala kasi akong stable income ngayon, I'm currently in between jobs. So parang hindi practical for me to get insurance now. 🙅

Agent: That's tough, Maria. But actually, having insurance can act as a safety net during unpredictable times, like in between jobs. It can also give you peace of mind. Our policies are designed to be very affordable. Is there a specific budget you're comfortable with?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to find a budget that works, but I have another financial worry.</reflect>To be honest, Alex, may loan pa akong binabayaran. I'm still paying it off, so adding another expense like insurance feels like too much for me right now. 😢

Agent: I appreciate your honesty, Maria. Having existing financial obligations can surely make you think twice. FWD understands that. We have specific plans that could actually complement your existing financial plans and still fit your budget. Think of it as a way to protect your current and future financial health. What do you think?

Maria: <reflect>He’s making a point about fitting insurance into my financial plans...</reflect>I can see where you're coming from, Alex, pero parang nakakatakot pa rin. What if my situation worsens and I can't keep up with the payments? 🙆

Agent: I hear you, Maria. That's a real concern. What's nice about FWD is that we offer grace periods and flexible payment terms to help you manage your policy, even if things go south for a bit. Circumstances change, and we get that. How does that sound for you?

Maria: <reflect>Flexible terms and grace periods could be helpful...</reflect>That’s reassuring to know, Alex. But still, how will this benefit me in the long run? Parang I still feel unsure.

Agent: Great question. In the long run, having insurance can provide financial security and peace of mind. It ensures that medical bills or unforeseen expenses don’t drain your savings. Plus, with FWD, you can get benefits like investment opportunities and potential returns on your policy. Wouldn’t that be a great way to secure your future?

Maria: <reflect>He’s talking about long-term benefits, sounds promising...</reflect>Okay, I see your point, but could you explain more about this investment part? How does it work? 🤔

Agent: Absolutely! So, some of our plans have an investment component. Essentially, part of your premium is invested in various portfolios, giving you potential returns over time. It's like hitting two birds with one stone—you're insured and your money grows! How do you feel about that?

Maria: <reflect>Investment part sounds interesting and useful...</reflect>Hmm, that’s something I didn’t expect. Sounds useful nga! So, I can actually earn from this policy? That’s quite the twist!

Agent: Yes, exactly! It's one of the benefits of choosing FWD. You’re not just getting coverage; you’re also making your money work for you. Imagine enjoying the benefits of both insurance and investment. Doesn't that sound like hitting the jackpot?

Maria: <reflect>He’s quite convincing about the dual benefits...</reflect>Haha, jackpot! You make it sound very tempting, Alex. Pero I still need to think it over, kasi it’s a big decision. 🙏

Agent: Of course, Maria. It’s important to take your time and consider all angles. If you have any other questions or need more information, I'm just a message away. You know, making an informed decision is key, and I'll support you through every step. How does that sound?

Maria: <reflect>He's very accommodating; I should ask something more specific now...</reflect>That’s nice to hear. One more thing, Alex, paano if something happens and I can't pay for the policy anymore? Are there any harsh penalties? 😢

Agent: That’s a valid concern, Maria. With FWD, if for any reason you can’t continue paying, there are options like converting your policy to a paid-up policy or reinstating it within a certain period without harsh penalties. It’s designed to be as accommodating as possible. How does knowing that make you feel?

Maria: <reflect>Flexible options for payment failures sound good too...</reflect>Thanks for explaining, Alex. That actually makes me feel better about the risks.🙆
