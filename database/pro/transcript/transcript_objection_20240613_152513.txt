 Agent: So, Maria, now that we've gone through all the product details, what do you think so far?

Maria: <reflect>I have no kids and I'm not supporting anyone. This should be mentioned.</reflect>Well, you see, Alex, I'm not married yet and I don't have kids. Plus, I'm not really supporting anyone with my income. So, I feel like there's no rush for me to get insurance. 😬

Agent: I understand your point, Maria. Being single and not having dependents can make it seem like insurance isn't urgent. However, life insurance also provides benefits like savings and investment options, which can be quite useful even for individuals who aren't supporting others. 

Maria: <reflect>Not in a hurry because I want to compare products from other companies as well.</reflect>That's interesting, Alex. But I think I would want to compare what's available from other companies too. 🤔

Agent: Absolutely, comparing products is a wise approach, Maria. But one thing to consider is that FWD Insurance offers unique benefits like flexible payment terms and customer-centric policies that you may not find elsewhere. Plus, we have a strong customer support service to assist with any concerns.

Maria: <reflect>I prefer to do my research. I should tell him that.</reflect>You know, Alex, I prefer to do my own research and find out more about these things on my own time. 🙆

Agent: That's totally understandable, Maria. Doing your own research is crucial. Just keep in mind that FWD Insurance also provides online resources and customer service support to help you get accurate information and make informed decisions. 

Maria: <reflect>Addressing the issue that there's no one relying on my income.</reflect>But, going back to my point, there's really no one relying on my income right now, so I don't feel a pressing need.😅

Agent: I get that, Maria. Just remember that life insurance isn't just for dependents; it's also about securing your future and hitting your financial goals. It can provide a safety net for you in case of unexpected events, ensuring that you're financially stable.

Maria: <reflect>Insurance can be a safety net even for me. Ask more about potential savings benefits.</reflect>Okay, I see your point. Maybe you can explain a bit more about the savings benefits you've mentioned. 🙏

Agent: Sure, Maria! Our policies often come with built-in saving components, which grow over time. This means while you're covered by insurance, you're also building a constructive financial habit by saving money regularly. How does that sound to you?

Maria: <reflect>Savings aspect sounds interesting. But I heard about premium increases without clear reason. I should bring that up.</reflect>That does sound good, Alex. Speaking of premiums, though, I've heard that they sometimes increase without a clear reason. How does FWD handle that?🤔

Agent: Great question, Maria. At FWD, we ensure transparency with our customers. We provide clear explanations for any changes in premiums, if they occur. Plus, we offer fixed-premium plans for certain policies to give you peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>Prefer transparency in the plans. Addressing concerns about not knowing FWD well.</reflect>That's reassuring, Alex. You know, this is the first time I've heard of FWD. How long has the company been around? 🙆

Agent: FWD actually started in Asia in 2013, and we've quickly grown to be a significant player in the region, including the Philippines. We're part of a larger group with a strong financial backing, ensuring sustainability and reliability for our clients.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, they seem stable. Explore more about the flexible policy options. </reflect>Hmm, that sounds solid. So, you mentioned earlier about flexible payment terms and policy adjustments. Can you elaborate on that? 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, Maria! We offer flexible payment options, which means you can choose how frequently you'd like to pay—monthly, quarterly, or annually. Additionally, many of our policies can be adjusted over time to better suit your changing needs.

Maria: <reflect>Flexible payment terms are a plus. Interested in the personalization aspect.</reflect>Wow, flexible payments are a plus. And you mentioned something about policies that can be adjusted? How does that work exactly? 🙋

Agent: Yes, our policies are designed to grow with you. For instance, as your financial situation changes, you can adjust your coverage amount or shift between different benefits within the policy. This ensures that your insurance remains relevant to your life circumstances.

Maria: <reflect>Growing with the insurance sounds appealing. But I still want to take my time.</reflect>That definitely sounds appealing, Alex. Look, I appreciate all these details, but I really want to take my time to think over everything. 🙆

Agent: I completely understand, Maria. Making an informed decision is key. Just remember that we're here to support you anytime with any questions or further clarifications you might need.

Maria: <reflect>They've been very helpful. Keep the conversation light and fun.</reflect>Thanks so much, Alex. You’ve been really helpful and informative. Nakakatawa, I thought talking about insurance would be boring, pero hindi pala! 😂

Agent: I'm glad to hear that, Maria! Insurance should never be boring, especially when it's about securing your future. If you ever need more info or just want to chat about anything, don't hesitate to reach out.

Maria: <reflect>Ending this on a positive note. </reflect>I will, Alex. Thanks again for all the information. Looking forward to learning more. 😄
