 Agent: Maria, it's so great to finally meet you and talk about what FWD has to offer. Now that we've gone through the product details, what do you think so far?

Maria: <reflect>Mmm, they did sound interesting, but I still have some concerns. Let me think about how to phrase them.</reflect>Yes, Mark, the details were very comprehensive, but... I've heard some people talk about these premium increases without any clear reason. 🤔

Agent: I understand your concern. Premium adjustments might seem daunting, pero we're very transparent about those changes. Any potential increase is explained thoroughly and justified. Plus, our goal is always to keep it reasonable for our clients.

Maria: <reflect>Transparency is good. Let's bring up my second concern.</reflect>Okay, I appreciate the clarity. Now, I’ve read that FWD is relatively new in the market compared to other big players. How does that affect your stability and trustworthiness?🙏

Agent: Valid question, Maria. Although FWD is a newer player here, we are part of an established global network. In fact, our parent company has a long-standing history of financial strength and trustworthiness. Plus, our innovative approach is backed by this solid foundation.

Maria: <reflect>Global network and foundation sound reassuring. Another point...</reflect>Alright, but, in fairness, to build a relationship is important to me. I heard about your company from a friend, but I'd rather buy from someone I know personally.🙆

Agent: That's totally understandable. Building trust is essential, and that's why we're committed to being reachable and building those personal connections with our clients. We believe in creating relationships, not just transactions. Maybe we can get to know each other better over more conversations like this.

Maria: <reflect>He seems sincere about building trust. Let's think this through some more.</reflect>You're right; trust builds over time. I'll give that some thought. Talking about long relationships, does FWD allow flexibility if I need to adjust my policy later on?🤔

Agent: Yes, Maria, flexibility is key for us. Life changes, so your insurance should too. We have options to adjust coverage as your needs evolve—whether that’s adding benefits or changing terms. You won't be stuck with a one-size-fits-all policy.

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility is pretty important for me. Let's explore more practical aspects.</reflect>Good to know. Now, I heard that the premiums can be quite high. Is it true that they are expensive compared to other companies?

Agent: Premium costs can vary depending on the coverage and benefits tailored to your needs. However, we aim to offer competitive rates without compromising on the quality and value of the coverage. We can always review and find a balance that fits your budget.

Maria: <reflect>Balancing cost and coverage makes sense. Let's talk about something else now.</reflect>That's a fair answer. How about the benefits again? Specifically, what makes FWD's benefits stand out from the rest?💬

Agent: Great question, Maria! Well, unlike many, we offer additional features like digital services for easier claims processing, wellness programs for maintaining health, and telemedicine services which let you consult doctors from the comfort of your home. It’s all about providing more value beyond just the policy.

Maria: <reflect>Digital services and telemedicine sound very modern. Let's see if they have local expertise.</reflect>Those sound pretty advanced. Does FWD have a strong local presence and understanding of the Filipino market?🙆

Agent: Absolutely. We make sure our products and services cater to the local market's specific needs. With our team of experts here in the Philippines, we're always ready to provide support tailored to our local clients’ lifestyles and preferences.

Maria: <reflect>Knowing that they understand the local market helps. I'll now ask something more personal.</reflect>Great to hear that. Btw, what inspired you to work in the insurance industry?🤔

Agent: A good question, Maria. Honestly, it's all about helping people. The satisfaction I get from knowing I'm making a difference in clients' lives is incomparable. Plus, being part of a forward-thinking company like FWD makes it even more fulfilling.

Maria: <reflect>He sounds genuinely passionate. That’s nice to know.</reflect>That’s inspiring, Mark. Knowing your passion for this, what has been your most memorable experience with a client?💬

Agent: Oh, that's a tough one. There have been many, but one that stands out is helping a client secure a policy that eventually supported her family during a tough time. She sent me a heartfelt thank you note that still motivates me today. 

Maria: <reflect>Inspiring stories build connection. Talking about personal experience is nice.</reflect>That’s really touching. It’s good to know that insurance can make such a big difference in people’s lives. 🙆

Agent: It truly can, Maria. And that's what we're here for. To ensure you and your loved ones have peace of mind. Do you or your family already have any existing coverage or are you looking for something specific?

Maria: <reflect>Talking about specifics might help me learn more. I do have some coverage already.</reflect>We do have some coverage already, but I'm curious if FWD offers something that complements what we already have. 🤔

Agent: Absolutely, we can certainly look into complementing your existing coverage. It’s about finding gaps and ensuring you have comprehensive protection. Would you like to go into more details about your current coverage, so we can tailor something for you?
