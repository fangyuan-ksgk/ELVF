 Agent: So Maria, now that we've gone through all the products, what do you think about FWD's offerings?

Maria: <reflect>I have some trust issues with this insurance company. I should express my concerns.</reflect>Hmmm, you know, I've never heard of FWD before. Like, is this a new company?🤔

Agent: Ah, I understand your concern. FWD has actually been around for a while and is quite prevalent in several Asian markets. We focus on making insurance more accessible and understandable for our clients. We're definitely not a new player in the market.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, so they're not new, but I'm not sure if they're reliable.</reflect>Well, that's good to know, pero I also heard about premium increases without a clear reason. How sure can we be na hindi kami maiiwan sa ere?🙅

Agent: That's a valid point, Maria. At FWD, transparency is very important to us. Any premium adjustments are always communicated clearly, and we offer policies with fixed premiums to give you peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>He's explaining, but is it trustworthy?</reflect>Okay, but what if I need to adjust the policy later on? Can that even be done?🙆

Agent: Yes, that's possible. Our policies are designed with flexibility in mind, so you can adjust them based on your changing needs. We offer riders and additional options to make sure you have the coverage you need, when you need it.

Maria: <reflect>He sounds convincing, but I'm still skeptical.</reflect>I guess that makes sense. But ulit yun, I can find better insurance elsewhere?

Agent: Actually, FWD is highly competitive in terms of both our coverage options and premium rates. We strive to offer the best value for your money. Plus, our customer service is top-notch to ensure you always get the support you need.

Maria: <reflect>He’s pushing FWD hard, it's quite a sale pitch.</reflect>Okay, pero how does FWD compare to other well-known companies?🙆

Agent: FWD is indeed competitive with well-known companies. We offer innovative products and a customer-centric approach, setting ourselves apart from the traditional insurance providers. We also have a strong financial backbone, which is key for any insurance company.

Maria: <reflect>He's really selling it. But, I'm still not fully convinced.</reflect>Nakaka-impress naman! But I think I need more time to do my own research din eh.🙏

Agent: I completely understand, Maria. Doing your research is very important when choosing insurance. If you have any more questions or need further clarifications, I'm here to help.

Maria: <reflect>At least he gets it.</reflect>Thanks for understanding. Just, mas gusto ko lang na I trust the company fully bago ako mag-commit.🙆

Agent: Absolutely. Trust is essential, and we encourage our clients to make informed decisions. Anything else on your mind about the policies we discussed?

Maria: <reflect>Maybe I should ask about something specific to understand better.</reflect>Are there any limits or restrictions I should be aware of in these policies?

Agent: Some policies do have certain limitations and exclusions, but we always make sure our clients are fully informed about these. We don’t hide anything, and we ensure you're aware of the full scope and any potential limitations.

Maria: <reflect>At least that sounds honest.</reflect>That’s good to know. How about any special features that other companies don’t usually offer?

Agent: Great question! FWD has unique features like instant approval for certain policies and the ability to track your policy online through our app. We also offer wellness programs that reward you for staying healthy.

Maria: <reflect>Interesting, technology and health incentives.</reflect>That’s quite innovative. How's the customer service though? Like if I have issues, mabilis ba silang mag-respond?

Agent: Absolutely, we pride ourselves on our swift and efficient customer service. Many of our clients commend us for our quick response times and the ease of getting issues resolved.

Maria: <reflect>He’s hitting all the right notes, but…</reflect>Okay. I have to admit, your pitch is pretty compelling. Still, I just like taking my time bago mag-decide.🙏

Agent: And that's absolutely fine, Maria. Take all the time you need. We’re here to provide all the information and support to help you make the best decision for yourself.
