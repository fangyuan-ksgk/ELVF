 Agent: As I mentioned, FWD provides a variety of life insurance products tailored to fit your needs, Maria. This would offer you peace of mind, knowing that you and your loved ones are protected. 

Maria: <reflect>He presented everything very well, but I feel like it's really not the right time for me to get this.</reflect>You know, Alex, now is really not a good time. I'm quite busy with work and personal projects – parang it's something I can consider next time. 🙅

Agent: I understand, Maria. Timing is crucial. However, life insurance is also about being prepared for the unexpected. It’s something that can protect your future even when you’re busy with your present. Hindi mo kailangang i-rush ngayon, but starting early means you secure better rates habang you're young and healthy.

Maria: <reflect>I'm still young and healthy; I'm not in a hurry.</reflect>Hmm, but I'm still young and healthy. Parang I don't need this just yet.🤔

Agent: That's great to hear na you're in good health, Maria! Actually, that’s precisely the best time to think about life insurance – when you’re at your healthiest. It can be more affordable and easier to apply for. You’re setting yourself up for success in the long run.

Maria: <reflect>I don't have kids or a spouse yet; it feels unnecessary.</reflect>Well, I’m not married, I don't have kids, and nobody is really dependent on my income. So parang unnecessary expense pa rin. 🙆

Agent: That makes sense, Maria. Pero life insurance isn’t just for those with dependents. It can also take care of your future medical expenses, ensure your retirement fund, and even help you with wealth planning. It’s also a good way to leave something behind for your future self.

Maria: <reflect>He's got valid points but I still feel it's not my priority right now.</reflect>There’s truth in what you’re saying, Alex, but parang saving money is important for me din.🤔

Agent: Absolutely, Maria, saving is essential. The good thing about life insurance is that it's also a form of saving. Some plans even offer cash value growth over time. It’s like hitting two birds with one stone – protection and savings.

Maria: <reflect>I should show I understand but maintain my hesitation.</reflect>It sounds appealing, I'll admit. Just that, right now, di ko pa talaga priority. 🙅

Agent: That's perfectly okay, Maria. Ang maganda naman with life insurance is it's there when you're ready. I just wanted to share the benefits ngayon palang so you know your options. Anything else that's on your mind about this?

Maria: <reflect>I'm curious about what makes FWD unique; I might as well ask.</reflect>By the way, why should I consider FWD over other insurance companies?🤔

Agent: Good question, Maria! FWD is known for its customer-centric approach and innovative products. We’re dedicated to making insurance simpler and more relevant for today’s savvy customers. Did I mention we offer fully digital solutions, too?

Maria: <reflect>That sounds interesting, but I'm still cautious.</reflect>Wow, that's interesting to know. But maybe I'll still take my time to compare products and do some more research before deciding. 🙏

Agent: And that's a very smart move, Maria. Knowing your options and understanding your needs will help you make the best decision. If you have any questions while doing so, I'm always here to help.

Maria: <reflect>He's being very accommodating; I'll thank him for that.</reflect>Thanks, Alex, I appreciate your time and patience in explaining everything to me.👍

Agent: Anytime, Maria. It's my pleasure to assist you. Remember, your financial security is my priority. If there's anything else you want to know or discuss, just let me know.

Maria: <reflect>I'll think about whether I have more questions or not.</reflect>Sure, I’ll keep that in mind. Til then, I’ll think about everything we discussed.🤔

Agent: That's absolutely fine. It's been a pleasure chatting with you about this. Anything else you'd like to touch on before we wrap things up for today?

Maria: <reflect>He's very professional; maybe I should ask a bit more to clarify things.</reflect>Maybe one more thing – how flexible are these plans if my financial situation changes?💬

Agent: That's an important aspect to consider, Maria. FWD offers flexible payment options and adjustable coverage plans to fit different life stages and financial situations. You can always update your policy as your needs change. 

Maria: <reflect>He seems to have covered everything I was hesitant about.</reflect>Hmm, that sounds promising. Thanks for clarifying that.🙆

Agent: No problem at all, Maria. It's great that you're considering all aspects. If you have any more questions, lalo na regarding the flexibility of our plans, just let me know. 

Maria: <reflect>I've asked all I wanted for now; I should show appreciation again.</reflect>Thanks! Very informative discussion, Alex.🙏

Agent: Glad to be of help, Maria! Feel free to reach out anytime you're ready or if more questions pop into your mind.
