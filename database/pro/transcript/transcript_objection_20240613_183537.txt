 Agent: So, Maria, given everything we've discussed, do you see how FWD's insurance policy could benefit you? 

Maria: <reflect>I still have some reservations, I should address my concerns.</reflect>Well, I see the benefits, but I'm honestly unsure. For one, I don't really believe in insurance. Feels like it's just unnecessary, you know? 🙅

Agent: I understand where you're coming from. A lot of people feel that way at first. But think of it as a safety net. Just like a seatbelt, you hope you never need it, but it's good to have it. What, though, if there's an emergency?

Maria: <reflect>He makes a point, but I should explain further why I feel it's unnecessary.</reflect>I'm really healthy kasi, and I take good care of myself. Plus, I have my own emergency fund set up already. So for me, it's like double protection na. 🙆

Agent: That's great to hear that you're maintaining a healthy lifestyle, Maria. However, even the healthiest among us aren't immune to unexpected events. Having insurance complements your emergency fund. Imagine it like having a Plan A and Plan B.

Maria: <reflect>He mentioned planning, but I'm cautious about overpaying for something that might not be useful.</reflect>I see what you're saying, but it still feels like overpaying for coverage I don't need. I can invest that money elsewhere. 💬

Agent: Investing is a wise choice, Maria. But insurance and investments serve different purposes. Investments grow your wealth, while insurance protects it. For instance, do you know that the cash value in some of our policies can actually be used as an additional investment?

Maria: <reflect>He's combining insurance with investment. I should ask more about this feature.</reflect>Really? So you're saying part of what I pay can work like an investment too? That's intriguing. 🤔

Agent: Exactly! Some of our products offer that feature. You can think of it as hitting two birds with one stone—protection and growth. You get peace of mind and potential financial gain.

Maria: <reflect>He's making it sound beneficial, but I should make sure I fully get it.</reflect>Okay, that does sound beneficial. How does the investment part work? Does it require me to pay more? 🙆

Agent: Not necessarily. It depends on the type of policy you choose. We have flexible options tailored to different needs and budgets. You can start with a basic plan and upgrade later if you see fit.

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility sounds good, but I need to ensure it's not an unnecessary expense.</reflect>Flexible sounds good, but I still hesitate kasi I don't want to add an unnecessary expense. How do you determine if the policy is exactly what I need? 🙏

Agent: Great question! We conduct a thorough needs analysis to customize the policy. We consider your lifestyle, financial goals, and risk tolerance to find the ideal plan for you. 

Maria: <reflect>He's being thorough, but I need to be clear about my unique situation.</reflect>Okay, that makes sense. What if I have unique circumstances or changes in my financial situation? Can the policy adapt to that? 🤔

Agent: Absolutely, Maria! Our policies are designed to be adaptive. We can review and adjust your plan periodically to match any changes in your life or financial situation.

Maria: <reflect>That's reassuring, but I want examples of real-life situations.</reflect>It’s comforting to know the policy is adaptable. Can you give me examples of situations where adjustments were needed? 🙆

Agent: Sure! For instance, many of our clients start with a basic plan and later add riders when they start a family. Or, someone in a high-risk job might opt for additional coverage. We adjust the plans based on what's happening in our clients' lives.

Maria: <reflect>I understand better now, but I need to consider if it fits into my current financial strategy.</reflect>Alright, that sounds reasonable. I'll need to see if it fits into my current financial strategy, though. What's the next step if I decide to consider this? 🤔

Agent: The next step would be to assess your current situation further and then customize a plan. But there's no rush, Maria. Take your time to think this through.

Maria: <reflect>I appreciate the no-pressure approach. Let’s keep this discussion going.</reflect>That's good to hear. It's a big decision, so I appreciate you letting me take my time. 🙏

Agent: Of course. Insurance is a commitment, and it's important to feel confident about it. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

Maria: <reflect>It's an engaging conversation, I should keep it light.</reflect>You’ve given me a lot to think about; ang dami ko nang natutunan. Maybe next time, you can teach me how to manage my time as well as you manage these policies! 🙆
