 Agent: Maria, it's so wonderful you've taken the time to learn more about our policies at FWD Insurance. I'm genuinely excited to see how it can benefit you. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far?

Maria: <reflect>He’s being thorough with the details, but I have some concerns about this company.</reflect>You know, I’ve been thinking, isn’t FWD a new company? How do I know I can trust it? 🤔

Agent: That’s a great question, Maria. FWD is relatively new in the Philippines, but we’re backed by one of the largest insurance companies in Asia, Pacific Century Group. So even if we’re new here, we have a strong and stable foundation. Does that help ease your concern a bit?

Maria: <reflect>Sounds reassuring, but I still need more info about their reputation.</reflect>Mmm, okay, but I haven't heard much about FWD before. Are there any major clients or projects you can share that might give me more confidence? 💬

Agent: Absolutely! We've actually been expanding rapidly and have partnerships with big names in the industry, including some well-known banks. Plus, we've gotten excellent feedback from our clients regarding our customer service and quick claims process. Trust me, Maria, our track record is better than you might think.

Maria: <reflect>Still, I'm cautious because of what I’ve heard about premium increases.</reflect>I've heard some stories about insurance companies increasing premiums without clear reasons. How does FWD handle that? 🙅

Agent: I understand your concern, Maria. At FWD, we are transparent with our policyholders. Any adjustments to premiums are thoroughly explained and legally regulated. Plus, we offer flexible payment options to accommodate various budgets, which helps manage premium changes more easily.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, that’s somewhat comforting, but I’m still on the fence.</reflect>Alright, but what if circumstances change and I need to adjust the policy later on? Can I do that, or will it be difficult? 💬

Agent: Excellent point, Maria. Our policies are built with flexibility in mind. We understand that life changes and you might need different coverage at different times. You can easily adjust your policy as your situation changes. You're definitely not locked into one plan forever.

Maria: <reflect>It's reassuring that they can be flexible. Still, overall trust in new companies is a concern.</reflect>Hmmm, that’s good to hear, but I’m just more comfortable with companies I know. What would make FWD stand out for someone like me? 🤔

Agent: Maria, I totally get it. What makes FWD stand out is our focus on innovative products and a customer-first approach. For example, we offer unique plans that focus not just on life insurance but also on wellness and mental health, which aren't as common in the industry. Add to that our streamlined online services—you can manage your policy, file claims, and get support all online. It’s convenience at its best.

Maria: <reflect>Interesting, but I’m not completely sold yet.</reflect>Well, that certainly sounds innovative. But what happens if, for example, I hear about an issue, like a problematic claim process? How does FWD handle complaints and issues? 🙆

Agent: Great question, Maria. We have a dedicated customer service team that is quick to respond and resolve any issues. We take feedback seriously and continuously improve our processes to ensure a smooth experience. Plus, we have excellent ratings in customer satisfaction.

Maria: <reflect>It’s good to know they handle issues seriously. Still, I want to save money too.</reflect>Okay, I hear you. But frankly speaking, saving money is very important to me. How can FWD offer me benefits that outweigh the cost? 🙏

Agent: I'm glad you brought that up, Maria. While saving money is crucial, consider the long-term benefits. Our policies not only provide financial security but also come with added perks like free medical consultations, wellness programs, and loyalty rewards. These benefits can save you a lot down the road, both financially and health-wise.

Maria: <reflect>Those perks sound appealing. I think I need more clarity.</reflect>Hmm, interesting benefits, Alex. But I'd still want to compare this with other options. What unique feature does FWD have that other companies might not offer? 🤔

Agent: FWD offers a very unique product called Set for Life, which includes not just life insurance, but also offers critical illness coverage, accident coverage, and even investment opportunities—all in one policy. It’s quite a comprehensive package that you won't find easily elsewhere.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds robust, but more information never hurts.</reflect>Wow, that's an all-in-one deal! But research is still important to me. How can I make sure I’m making the right choice? 🙆

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. It's smart to do thorough research. I suggest looking at customer reviews and independent ratings of insurance companies, as well as consulting with a financial advisor if you have one. At FWD, we're confident that our offerings stack up well against the competition. Do let me know if you have any specific areas you want to research further, and I’d be happy to provide more details.

Maria: <reflect>He’s being quite helpful.</reflect>Thanks, Alex. I’ll definitely dig deeper into this. By the way, just out of curiosity, does FWD offer anything for students or younger people? 😇
