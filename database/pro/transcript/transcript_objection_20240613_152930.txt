 Agent: Maria, it was really great going through all the details of our insurance plans with you. Do you have any questions or concerns?

Maria: <reflect>Before making any decisions, I should express some concerns first so I can make sure I'm doing the right thing.</reflect>Kamusta, finally nice to meet you. Pero, you mentioned FWD, right? I have to admit, hindi pa ako masyadong familiar with your company compared to others.ðŸ¤”

Agent: Ah, I totally understand that, Maria. FWD is one of the fastest-growing insurance companies in Asia. We're relatively new in the Philippines but we've already made significant achievements here. We've been working hard to build our reputation by offering innovative and customer-centric products. 

Maria: <reflect>Even if they're new and they claim to be good, I still want to compare their offerings with other companies to be sure.</reflect>Well, that's interesting to know. But, yung totoo, Iâ€™m still thinking na I want to compare your products with those from other companies to see which one suits me best.ðŸ™†

Agent: That makes perfect sense, Maria. Actually, doing your research is really smart! What sets us apart is our approach to making things simple and transparent for our clients. Plus, we offer some unique features that you might not find elsewhere, like our no-fuss claims process and wellness benefits.

Maria: <reflect>Transparency is important, but I'd like to feel more secure by knowing I have options to adjust my policy later on.</reflect>Okay, I hear you. But can I adjust the policy later on if my needs change? I don't want to be stuck with something that won't fit my situation in the future.ðŸ¤”

Agent: Great question, Maria! Our policies are indeed flexible. Whether it's increasing your coverage, adding riders, or making changes to your beneficiaries, you have the option to adjust as your needs evolve. We designed it to grow with you.

Maria: <reflect>They seem flexible, but I'm also worried about unexpected premium increases.</reflect>Well, that's nice to know. Pero I also heard about premium increases happening kapag walang clear reason. How does FWD handle that?ðŸ’¬

Agent: That's another valid concern, Maria. Our premium adjustments are always communicated well in advance, and they're based on thorough assessments and market conditions. We make sure our clients are never caught off guard by these changes, and we're always here to discuss these adjustments with you.

Maria: <reflect>They have answers to my concerns, but Iâ€™d feel better knowing Iâ€™m working with someone I trust or at least know well.</reflect>Hmm, well, I appreciate all the info. I have to admit, though, I feel more comfortable buying insurance from someone I know personally.ðŸ™…

Agent: Of course, trust is essential, Maria. That's why we emphasize building strong relationships with our clients from the start. And even if we're just getting to know each other now, I'm here to support you throughout your entire journey with FWD. We aim to be more than just a provider; we want to be your partner in securing your future.

Maria: <reflect>He seems quite reassuring and well-informed. Maybe itâ€™s worth giving it more consideration.</reflect>Okay, I appreciate your patience and all the clarifications. It's a lot to think about, for sure.ðŸ™†

Agent: Totally understandable, Maria. This is a big decision, and it's important to take your time to consider all aspects. If there are any other questions or doubts you have, I'm here to help.

Maria: <reflect>Thinking more deeply about my concerns and their responses.</reflect>Alright, I'll need to digest all this information. But thanks for answering all my questions so far.ðŸ™†

Agent: No problem at all, Maria. That's exactly what I'm here for. By the way, did any particular feature or benefit stand out to you during our discussion?

Maria: <reflect>Sharing what stood out might help clarify my thoughts and make the decision easier.</reflect>Actually, yung ease of claims process caught my interest. I think it's very beneficial, especially since you never know when emergencies will happen.ðŸ¤”

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. We aim to minimize stress during difficult times with our hassle-free claims process. It's all about giving you peace of mind when you need it the most.

Maria: <reflect>These features are compelling, but I still need to weigh my options and do more research.</reflect>That makes sense. But like I said, Iâ€™ll still need to either compare or talk to a couple more companies before making any decision. ðŸ’¬

Agent: Of course, Maria. I encourage you to do so and gather all the information you need. And whenever you're ready to discuss further, you know where to find me!

Maria: <reflect>It's good to know I can come back to him when I'm ready. I should keep the conversation going but maybe change the topic for now.</reflect>Thanks, appreciate it! Just curious, do you do other product promos or workshops for potential clients?ðŸ™†
