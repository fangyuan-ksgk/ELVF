 Agent: Maria, I'm really glad we went through all those details together. Knowing more about FWD, how do you feel about securing your future with insurance?

Maria: <reflect>I need to convey that I'm not in a rush and still need to talk to my family.</reflect>Hmm, you've provided a lot of good information. But you know, I think I need to speak to my family first before making any decisions. 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, Maria, it's always good to discuss these things with loved ones. May I ask, are there specific concerns or questions you think your family might have?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to address my concerns; I need to reassure him this isn't an urgent matter.</reflect>Ang family ko, they always have a lot of questions, sobra! Hahaha! But I guess, it’s more about making sure it's the right timing for all of us. We have other priorities at the moment, you know? 🙆

Agent: I understand, timing is everything talaga. May I know what your family’s top priorities are right now?

Maria: <reflect>He's delving deeper. I should keep it broad.</reflect>Well, we’re focusing on a few things like savings for potential big purchases, maybe travel din. Things like that. 🤔

Agent: That's exciting! Traveling and big purchases are indeed significant. Speaking of priorities, how do you see insurance fitting into these future plans?

Maria: <reflect>I should emphasize that insurance isn't our top priority now.</reflect>Siyempre, it’s important din, pero right now, it’s just not at the top of our list. Maybe in the future kapag medyo settle na kami. 🙅

Agent: Totally understandable, Maria. It’s really about timing. You mentioned travel; do you have any specific destinations in mind? 

Maria: <reflect>He's steering the conversation to a lighter topic. I'll keep it fun.</reflect>Oh, we’ve been dreaming of going to Japan! Imagine, cherry blossoms and ramen! Now that's a dream trip. 💬

Agent: Wow, Japan! That sounds amazing! Cherry blossoms are on my bucket list din. Let me guess, Japan for the food and scenery?

Maria: <reflect>He's engaging me with something we're both excited about.</reflect>Yes! And the culture! Plus, I've always wanted to try wearing a kimono. Who knows, maybe I can blend in. Hahaha! 😂

Agent: That's awesome! You'll definitely look good in a kimono. Out of curiosity, during these travels, do you consider travel insurance or something similar?

Maria: <reflect>He's back on insurance subtly. Keep it casual.</reflect>Sometimes we do, especially for international trips. But mostly we're just thinking about having a good time and making memories. 🙆

Agent: Memories are the best part, indeed! Speaking of making memories, have you considered how life insurance fits in leaving a legacy for your loved ones? Just a thought...

Maria: <reflect>He's pulling it back again to the topic; I'll acknowledge but still keep it light.</reflect>It’s a good point. I mean, it’s nice to know that we can leave something behind, but I guess, for now, it’s something we’ll think more about later. 🙏

Agent: That makes sense. Planning talaga takes time, and rushing isn't the way to go. So aside from Japan, where else is on the bucket list?

Maria: <reflect>Keeping the conversation light while maintaining my stance on timing.</reflect>Oh, Paris naman! Eiffel Tower and croissants! Who wouldn't want that, right? 😂

Agent: Paris is a classic. Really, both Japan and Paris are fantastic choices. When you’re ready, planning for the future will blend seamlessly with making all those amazing memories. 

Maria: <reflect>He's wrapping it up nicely. I'll respond positively but no decisions yet.</reflect>Absolutely! We’ll definitely think about it. Creating memories today and planning for tomorrow, maybe we can do both, eventually. 🤗
