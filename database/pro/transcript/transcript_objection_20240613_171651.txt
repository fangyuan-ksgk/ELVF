 Agent: I understand the details can be overwhelming, but I'm here to make things clear for you. By the way, have you heard of FWD before?

Maria: <reflect>Nako, I should be honest about not knowing the company well.</reflect>Ay, actually, I haven't heard much about FWD before. It seems fairly new to me. 🤔

Agent: That’s okay, Maria. FWD is relatively new here in the Philippines but we've been making big waves in Asia. We're known for innovative and customer-friendly policies. How do you feel about the idea of a newer company providing your life insurance?

Maria: <reflect>Hmmm, being new might be risky. I should ask more about trustworthiness.</reflect>To be honest, it sounds interesting, but how can I be sure it’s trustworthy? I’ve heard stories about premium increases without clear reasons. 🤔

Agent: That's a valid concern, Maria. At FWD, we believe in full transparency. We provide clear and upfront information about any changes in your policy. Plus, we have a robust customer support system to address any queries or concerns.

Maria: <reflect>That's comforting. But still...</reflect>Mmm, I see. Pero, I'd rather buy from someone I know. Parang mas comfortable ako that way. 🙆

Agent: I understand that, Maria. Actually, that’s one of the reasons I’m here—I’m committed to being your point of contact at FWD and building that personal trust with you. You’ll always have someone familiar to reach out to.

Maria: <reflect>He's making good points, but let me think this through... 🤔</reflect>Makes sense. But what about adjusting the policy later on? I've heard it's hard to do that with some companies. Isn’t it strict?

Agent: Great question, Maria! With FWD, flexibility is key. We offer options to adjust your policy based on major life events like marriage, having children, or even changing jobs. It’s all part of making sure your insurance fits your needs as life changes.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, flexibility sounds good. He's addressing my concerns well. 🙆</reflect>Well, these features are quite appealing! I just need to be sure because, you know, money isn't always abundant. 💬

Agent: Absolutely, Maria! We offer a range of policy options to fit different budgets, so you can find something that’s affordable and still gives you the protection you need.

Maria: <reflect>He's really trying to be accommodating. I should ask about something specific... 🤔</reflect>Speaking of protection, how does FWD handle critical illnesses? I've heard stories na sometimes hindi daw naccover yung mga ganung issue. 🧐

Agent: That's a great point, Maria. We have comprehensive plans that cover critical illnesses. In fact, many of our policies include a rider for critical illness coverage, so you’re well-protected in those situations.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, sounds better than I thought. 🙆</reflect>Good to know. Alam mo, I'm really trying to be careful with my money. What about, let’s say, nagrarandom na kailangan ko ang fund, could I tap into this insurance somehow?

Agent: I understand, Maria. Some of our policies include a cash value component, which you can borrow against or withdraw in times of need. It’s another way we try to offer flexibility to our clients.

Maria: <reflect>This all sounds so reassuring. But I still need to ask... 🤔</reflect>About the premiums, di ba nagiging expensive? I've heard kasi that some policies have expensive premiums that increase over time.

Agent: Yes, that's another common concern. At FWD, we offer level-premium options where the amount you pay stays the same throughout the policy term. This helps you better manage your expenses over the long run.

Maria: <reflect>Steady premiums are appealing. Parang okay na... 🙆</reflect>A steady premium is really helpful for budgeting. Thanks for explaining it so well!

Agent: Absolutely, Maria, happy to help! Do you have any other concerns that I can clarify for you?

Maria: <reflect>He’s covered a lot already, but let me see if there's more to ask... 🤔</reflect>Maybe just one more thing. Can we talk a bit more about the claims process? I’ve heard na some companies make it difficult to claim, and that’s worrisome.

Agent: Definitely! At FWD, we pride ourselves on a smooth claims process. Our team aims to process claims quickly and efficiently, keeping everything transparent to reduce any additional stress during what could already be a challenging time.

Maria:  <reflect>All these sound good. Hindi siya masyado aggressive, which is nice... 🙆</reflect>Good to hear. You’ve really answered a lot of my questions; I appreciate your patience, Alex.

Agent: It’s my pleasure, Maria. Just want to make sure you’re comfortable and all your questions are answered.

Maria: <reflect>I should think about this more, no rush right now. 🙆</reflect>Yes, you've been very informative, Alex. I think I need to digest all this information first.
