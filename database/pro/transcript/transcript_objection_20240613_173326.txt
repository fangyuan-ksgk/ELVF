 Agent: I do understand your concerns, Maria. But let me assure you, FWD is known globally and we’re quickly becoming a favorite in the Philippines because of our innovative and customer-focused products. How about we dive into any specific concerns you might have?

Maria: <reflect>Let me list down my reservations clearly to guide the conversation.</reflect>Well, Alex, first off, what exactly is FWD? I mean, I haven't heard much about it. And isn’t FWD a new company? 🤔

Agent: Great questions, Maria! FWD, or Friends With Dreams, is actually part of the Pacific Century Group, a multi-billion-dollar organization, and it's been around since 2013. While we might be relatively new, our solid backing and rapid growth speak volumes. Does it make you feel more comfortable knowing our background?

Maria: <reflect>He’s explaining the background well, but I should address another concern.</reflect>Okay, I see. But, you know, I'd rather buy from someone I personally know or from a more established company. I feel more at ease that way. 🙅

Agent: I completely understand that, Maria. Trust is essential in any relationship, especially when it involves finances. What sets FWD apart is our openness and the fact that we use technology to be as transparent as possible, which helps to build that trust. Also, our customer reviews speak for themselves. Does that help ease your mind a bit?

Maria: <reflect>He addressed the trust aspect nicely, but I have another trust-related concern.</reflect>Hmm, maybe. But I also heard about premium increases without clear reasons. Isn't that something to worry about? 🤔

Agent: That's another valid point, Maria. At FWD, we strive for complete transparency. We communicate any changes in premiums well in advance and make sure our clients understand why adjustments are needed. It’s all about maintaining that trust. How do you feel about that approach?

Maria: <reflect>He's being thorough with his explanations. Time to give another thought.</reflect>Okay, you’re being thorough, I’ll give you that. But can I adjust the policy later on if I need to? 🙆

Agent: Absolutely! Flexibility is one of the core principles at FWD. We understand that life situations change and so do our needs. You can make adjustments to your coverage as necessary. Does that make the idea more appealing to you?

Maria: <reflect>His explanation about flexibility sounds good. I should pivot to another minor concern, for better clarity.</reflect>Oh, that's quite reassuring, actually. But, say, what if something happens and I'm not able to pay for a while? Is there some cushion for that? 🙏

Agent: Great question, Maria. We do have options for premium holidays and other flexible payment terms to ensure that you’re covered even if you face financial difficulties. We aim to provide the best support for our clients. Does that ease your worries?

Maria: <reflect>He's being very transparent and flexible. Time for another curiosity-driven question.</reflect>That's starting to sound better. By the way, do you also offer any special perks or benefits with your insurance? 🙆

Agent: Absolutely, Maria! We offer a range of benefits such as wellness programs, discounts on medical services, and even rewards for healthy living. These perks are all designed to add value for our policyholders. Any specifics you’re interested in?

Maria: <reflect>This perks part is getting interesting. I should probe a bit more.</reflect>Hmmm, tell me more about this wellness program. What does it include? 🙆

Agent: Our wellness program provides access to various health assessments, fitness activities, and even personal coaching to help you maintain a healthy lifestyle. It’s like having a personal wellness assistant! Does that sound like something you’d appreciate?

Maria: <reflect>Wow, that program does sound beneficial. Time for another small query.</reflect>Wow, a wellness assistant. That's amazing. So, if I sign up, how soon do I get access to the benefits? 🙅

Agent: You'll get access to most of the benefits almost immediately after your policy is in effect. We aim to provide value right from the start. Anything else you'd like to know?
