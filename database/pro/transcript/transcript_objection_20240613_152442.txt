 Agent: So Maria, now you know more about our life insurance policies and the various benefits they offer. Can I hear your thoughts on this matter?

Maria: <reflect>I should share my concerns about why I don’t feel the need for this right now.</reflect>Well, honestly, Alex, I'm not married and wala pa akong kids. So parang I don’t see the urgency in getting a life insurance policy. 🤔

Agent: I understand where you’re coming from, Maria. You might feel that it’s not immediately necessary. But considering life insurance early can actually be a smart move—you’ll be locking in lower premiums while you’re young and healthy. It’s like getting a head start!

Maria: <reflect>He’s making a point, but I still feel my situation doesn’t require immediate action.</reflect>That’s an interesting thought, Alex. But honestly, I’m not supporting anyone with my income right now. It seems like an unnecessary expense. 🙅

Agent: I get it, Maria. Currently, it might not seem like a priority. But think about your future self; it’s more about planning ahead. And our policies are very flexible—you can adjust them if your situation changes. Wouldn’t it be nice to have that peace of mind?

Maria: <reflect>He makes it sound appealing, but I really feel like this can wait.</reflect>Hmm, I suppose so. Ewan ko lang talaga, I’d rather compare products from different companies first. I like to do my research. 🙆

Agent: That's a wise approach, Maria. In fact, it’s great that you want to make an informed decision. May I suggest a look at our client testimonials and case studies? They might give you a clearer picture of why many people choose FWD. Is there any other information you’d like?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to be helpful with additional information, but I should stick to my need for research.</reflect>I appreciate that, Alex, but I think it’s better if I do some more personal research on my own. I heard from friends that premiums can increase without clear reasons, and that worries me.

Agent: That's a valid concern, Maria. With FWD, we’re very transparent about any changes in premiums, and our advisors are always available to explain anything you’re unsure about. Transparency is one of our core principles. How do you feel about that?

Maria: <reflect>He’s addressing my concern about transparency. That’s good, but I still feel it’s too soon.</reflect>I see. That’s reassuring, knowing that transparency is important for you guys. But still, I feel like I can find better insurance elsewhere. 🤔

Agent: It’s completely fair to look for the best fit for you. Remember, FWD is relatively new in the market but we have strong international backing and innovative solutions. Even if you don't decide right away, keeping your options open can’t hurt, right?

Maria: <reflect>He’s making a good point again, but let’s see how open they are to flexibility.</reflect>Okay, but here’s another thing—can I adjust the policy later on if I need to?

Agent: Absolutely, Maria! Our policies are designed to be flexible so you can make adjustments as your needs change. Whether you need to increase your coverage or make other changes, we’ve got you covered.

Maria: <reflect>He seems confident that their policy can adjust well, but I’m still hesitant about making a decision today.</reflect>Good to know. Flexibility is important to me. But, I don’t want to overpay for coverage I don't need. I think I need more time to think this over. 🙏

Agent: That’s perfectly fine, Maria. It’s important to feel confident in your decision. Remember, insurance is not just an expense; it’s an investment in your peace of mind and future security. Does that make sense?

Maria: <reflect>He’s framing it as an investment, which is a bit compelling. But I still feel like I want to wait.</reflect>Yes, it does sound like an investment. But I’m still thinking I might be saving enough already. And I have some assets, so I’m not entirely without a safety net. 🤔

Agent: Very understandable, Maria. Having a safety net is always good. But life insurance can add an extra layer of security, especially for unforeseen circumstances. It’s more about covering all your bases. Does that help ease some of your concerns?

Maria: <reflect>He’s really trying to address my concerns comprehensively. Maybe I should pivot a bit in the discussion.</reflect>I get that, Alex. You mentioned this insurance can also be adjusted? How exactly does that work if ever I decide to change any details later on? 🙆

Agent: Great question, Maria. Should you need to increase your coverage due to changes in your life—like starting a family or new financial responsibilities—we can adjust your policy accordingly. Conversely, if you need to cut back, we can look into that too. It’s very client-centric.

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility is indeed a good feature, but I'm still thinking about my immediate financial priorities.</reflect>That’s quite appealing, but right now, saving money is more important to me than anything else. You understand, right? 🙅

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Saving is crucial. But think of insurance as another form of savings, one that safeguards your future. Balancing both can provide a more holistic approach to your financial planning. Anyone else in your circle looking into insurance as well?

Maria: <reflect>He’s reframing saving but I’m not convinced yet.</reflect>Yes, I understand what you’re saying. But realistically, insurance isn’t a priority in my budget right now. I'm still paying off my loan, to be frank. 🤔

Agent: Thank you for sharing that, Maria. Managing loan payments are a priority, definitely. Maybe once you're a bit more comfortable financially, we can revisit this conversation. How about I keep you updated on any future deals or adjustments?

Maria: <reflect>He’s patient and flexible. Still, a lot on my plate...should keep options open.</reflect>Sure, keeping me updated sounds fair. I’ll think about it more once I’m in a better financial place.👍
