 Agent: So, Maria, as we discussed, the FWD insurance policy offers a lot of benefits like coverage for critical illnesses, flexibility in premium payments, and even investment options. What do you think about that?

Maria: <reflect>He’s asking for my opinion; I need to express my hesitation clearly and politely.</reflect>Well, Alex, everything you mentioned sounds really great. Ang ganda nga ng benefits, but you know, I feel like I need to speak to my family muna talaga before making any decisions. 🙆

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. It's really important to consult with your loved ones. But let me ask, are there specific concerns they might have that we could address now?

Maria: <reflect>He’s trying to address my potential concerns; I should share my reason for hesitation.</reflect>Actually, it's more about timing talaga. I have a lot on my plate right now, and getting insurance isn't really a priority for me at the moment. 🤔

Agent: Understandable, Maria. Life can get super busy. But did you know that having insurance can actually make things less hectic? It provides a safety net for you and your family, so in case something unexpected happens, you don’t have to worry as much.

Maria: <reflect>He’s highlighting how insurance can ease my worries; I need to acknowledge that but still express my current situation.</reflect>Kasi, Alex, right now I'm really focused on other commitments, especially my work and other expenses. Maybe I'll think about it more seriously in the future. 🙆

Agent: Totally get that, Maria. And just to let you know, we have flexible plans that can fit around your budget and schedule. This way, you’re not overwhelmed financially or time-wise.

Maria: <reflect>He’s emphasizing flexibility, I should inquire more about that.</reflect>Oh, that sounds interesting. What kind of flexible plans are we talking about here? 🤔

Agent: Great question, Maria! With FWD, you can actually start with a minimal premium and adjust it as your income grows or as your financial priorities change. Plus, you can select the coverages that best suit your needs so you're not paying for something unnecessary.

Maria: <reflect>This sounds good but still, I need to prioritize my expenses.</reflect>Mmm, I see your point there. But still, I think saving money is more important for me at this stage.🤔

Agent: Absolutely, saving is crucial. But consider this, Maria—insurance isn’t just an expense; it’s a form of savings too. It’s like having a financial backup plan that can supplement your savings in times of need.

Maria: <reflect>He’s pitching insurance as an alternative form of saving; I should acknowledge but still express my timing issue.</reflect>That makes sense naman, but as of now, I think it's just not the right time for me. I might consider it next time, when things aren’t as hectic. 🙆

Agent: I get it, Maria. Timing is everything, and it’s important to feel ready. Just keep in mind that the earlier you start, the more benefits you can enjoy over time. Sometimes, life happens and we're caught unprepared.

Maria: <reflect>He’s emphasizing the early start advantage; I should respond kindly but stand my ground.</reflect>I appreciate you explaining that, Alex. I can see the benefits, but like I said, maybe in the future when I feel more ready, okay?🙆

Agent: Of course, Maria. I respect your decision. But just one more thing, if you have any doubts or questions anytime, feel free to reach out. It might help make the decision easier when the time comes.

Maria: <reflect>He’s being respectful and open to future questions; I should acknowledge that.</reflect>Sure, Alex. I’ll definitely keep that in mind. Thanks for understanding. 👍

Agent: No problem at all, Maria. I’m here to help. By the way, since you mentioned you're busy with work, do you usually have time for personal activities or hobbies?

Maria: <reflect>He’s shifting to a more personal question; I should share something about myself.</reflect>Oh, definitely! I love doing yoga and sometimes I do volunteer work during weekends. It helps me relax and recharge. 🙏

Agent: That sounds amazing! It’s really great to have activities that help you unwind and give back. How long have you been into yoga?

Maria: <reflect>He’s asking about my yoga practice; I should give a brief answer and maybe ask him a different personal question.</reflect>I’ve been practicing yoga for about three years now. It’s been really beneficial for my mental health. How about you, do you have any hobbies na nakakarelax? 💬

Agent: Exercise does it for me. I usually jog around our village, and it really helps clear my mind. Would love to try yoga someday, it seems very relaxing.

Maria: <reflect>He's keeping the conversation light, I could share more about yoga.</reflect>You should try it! It’s really good for both body and mind. Maybe we can discuss some poses next time. 🙆

Agent: That would be great, Maria! I’m always open to learning new ways to stay healthy. Speaking of which, how do you usually stay motivated with your busy schedule?

Maria: <reflect>He’s asking about my motivation; I should give an honest answer.</reflect>Honestly, it’s all about setting small goals and having a support system. My friends and family really keep me going. 🙏
