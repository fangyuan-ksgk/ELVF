 Agent: Wow, itâ€™s great to be able to share all these details with you, Maria. What do you think so far, any questions or concerns?

Maria: <reflect>I have a few concerns I need to address, let's start with these 'no trust' issues.</reflect>Actually, I have a few concerns. First of all, what's FWD? I've heard itâ€™s a new company, and honestly, I havenâ€™t heard of FWD before.ðŸ¤”

Agent: Thatâ€™s a great question, Maria. FWD Insurance is actually part of the wider FWD Group, which has been around since 2013 and has operations across Asia. While we're relatively new in the Philippines, we've been making significant strides in the industry. Our innovative approach helps us stand out in the market. 

Maria: <reflect>He seems genuine, but I still have my doubts. I'll ask about premium increases next.</reflect>Oh, okay. That makes sense. But Iâ€™ve heard some stories about premium increases without clear reasons. Can you discuss that? ðŸ’¬

Agent: I understand your concern. Premiums can increase due to various factors, like changes in market conditions or adjustments based on claims experiences. However, we make it a point to communicate any changes transparently and as early as possible. Our goal is always to ensure that you understand what's happening with your policy.

Maria: <reflect>That explanation helps, but there's another issue I need clarification on.</reflect>Okay, but what about adjusting the policy later on? I heard itâ€™s not possible to make changes once itâ€™s set. ðŸ¤”

Agent: Actually, with FWD, flexibility is one of our main features. You can adjust your coverage or add riders according to your needs, as long as the changes comply with our policy terms. We want to make sure your insurance evolves with your life circumstances.

Maria: <reflect>The flexibility part sounds reassuring, but I want to touch on affordability.</reflect>Hmm, thatâ€™s good to know. But to be honest, how about the premiums? Iâ€™ve heard that they are quite expensive. ðŸ’¬

Agent: I can assure you, Maria, that our premiums are competitive. We offer different plans suited to various budgets, so we can work together to find something that fits comfortably within your financial plans. Plus, the benefits you get with our policies make it a valuable investment in your future. 

Maria: <reflect>He's covering the points well. Time to mention another concern about personal trust.</reflect>That sounds fair. But you know, I'd rather buy insurance from someone I know personally. Makes it easier to trust and communicate. ðŸ™…

Agent: I completely understand where you're coming from. Building trust is important. That's why we ensure continuous support and follow-ups. Even if weâ€™re just meeting today, youâ€™ll always have a contact point at FWD who you can reach out to anytime. Plus, our company places a strong emphasis on customer service.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, that somewhat reassures me. Let's shift a bit to my other concern then.</reflect>Thatâ€™s nice to know. You mentioned riders earlier. Can you explain a bit more about those? ðŸ’¬

Agent: Sure! Riders are additional coverages that you can add to your base policy to enhance protection. For example, you could add a critical illness rider or an accidental death benefit. These can be tailored based on your specific needs and what you want covered.

Maria: <reflect>Interesting, that gives more options. Time to address my budget concern fervently.</reflect>Interesting. But still, saving money is very important to me right now, especially since Iâ€™m still paying off my loan. ðŸ’¬

Agent: I understand, Maria. Managing finances can be challenging. Thatâ€™s why we offer options where you can choose the level of protection that suits your current budget. You can start with a basic plan and expand it as your financial situation improves.

Maria: <reflect>Flexible plans sound good; heâ€™s addressing my concerns with valid points.</reflect>Itâ€™s good to hear that there are options. Can you share any success stories of clients whoâ€™ve benefitted from your plans?ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely! I had a client who had a sudden medical emergency last year. Because he added a critical illness rider, he was able to cover his medical bills and focus on recovery without financial stress. These stories truly showcase the value of being prepared.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds reassuring. I should ask more about the claims process.</reflect>Impressive. But whatâ€™s the process like if I need to make a claim? Is it complicated? ðŸ™†

Agent: Great question! We strive to make the claims process as simple and efficient as possible. You can file a claim online or through our customer service, and we have a dedicated team to assist you every step of the way. The goal is to resolve claims quickly so you can get the support you need.

Maria: <reflect>Seems they have streamlined processes. Let's check on policy renewal next.</reflect>Thanks for clarifying. And how about renewals? Do policies renew automatically? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Yes, most of our policies are set to renew automatically, provided that premiums are paid on time. We will also send reminders ahead of time to ensure youâ€™re aware of the upcoming renewal. This way, you can maintain continuous coverage without any hassle.

Maria: <reflect>A reminder would indeed be helpful. Let's go back to whether they adjust premiums again. </reflect>Got it. And if there's a premium adjustment, will I be notified well in advance? ðŸ™…

Agent: Absolutely. Transparency is key for us. We ensure that any adjustments are communicated well in advance, with a detailed explanation so you know exactly why the change is happening. This way, you can make informed decisions about your policy.
