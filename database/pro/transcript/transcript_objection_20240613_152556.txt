 Agent: Earlier, we were discussing how life insurance can be beneficial in case of unforeseen circumstances. I understand you might have some reservations. Mind sharing what's on your mind, Maria?

Maria: <reflect>Let's start addressing these objections. Better lay it out.</reflect>Actually, Alex, I'm not really in a hurry to get life insurance... Look, I'm not married and I don't have kids, so it’s not like I’m supporting anyone with my income.🙆

Agent: I get that. Being single and independent is great! Have you considered though that life insurance isn't just about others? It's also securing your future, like for retirement or any health emergencies you might face. 

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, I see his point. But I have another concern.</reflect>Okay, I get that. Pero, I want to compare products from other companies muna. Need to see my options.🤔

Agent: That's very wise, Maria. Actually, you should compare! But let me share that FWD is known for its unique offerings like our “Set-for-Life” plan. We focus on flexibility, kaya you can always adjust it to fit your needs at any stage in your life. 

Maria: <reflect>He’s persistent. Let's go with another concern.</reflect>Flexible, huh? Still, I’d rather do my research. Plus, heard some about premium increases without clear reason.😹

Agent: That's a valid concern. At FWD, we believe in transparency. If there’s any increase in premiums, you'll be informed well in advance and it'll always be backed by proper reasons. And research is crucial, so take your time but remember, we're always here to help! 

Maria: <reflect>He's trying hard to be reassuring. However, another thing bothers me.</reflect>Well, you guys are kinda new, diba? I mean, I haven’t really heard much about FWD before. 🤔

Agent: True, we're relatively new in the Philippine market, but FWD is part of Pacific Century Group, which has a long-standing reputation in this field. We're here to innovate and change the way people perceive insurance.

Maria: <reflect>Gotta admit, kudos for the good branding and innovation pitch.</reflect>Okay, Impressive! I’'ll give you that. But how does this work if I decide not to continue with the policy later on? 

Agent: Great question! We offer a free-look period, so you can review your policy and if during that time, you feel it doesn’t meet your expectations, you can cancel and get a full refund. And if you decide to adjust later, we can work those changes into your plan.

Maria: <reflect>That’s actually thoughtful. He’s covering all my points</reflect>Hmmm, sounds reasonable... But what if I lose my job? How would I keep up with the premiums then?😏

Agent: That's a crucial concern, Maria. We have grace periods and alternative premium payment options to help you during financial setbacks. Life is unpredictable and we're here to work with you through those challenges.

Maria: <reflect>He’s covered things quite well. Let’s see another angle</reflect>Okay, pero can we talk about savings? I mean, isn’t saving money in the bank a better and safer option instead of paying for insurance premiums? 🙅

Agent: Ah yes, that's a good point. While saving in the bank is beneficial for short-term needs, a life insurance policy can complement that by providing financial security and protection from unforeseen events. It's like having a safety net that grows alongside your savings.

Maria: <reflect>It does sound practical the way he explains.</reflect>Interesting... but still, I’d rather invest my money directly into assets that I can control, rather than paying for something abstract like insurance.

Agent: Understandable. Investing directly in assets is smart. What life insurance offers is a mixture of security and investment. Some of our plans even have an investment component, so you're not only covered but also growing your wealth at the same time. 

Maria: <reflect>That sounds like an all-in-one package. Curious to know more.</reflect>Oh, really?! Investment plus coverage sounds good. How exactly does that work? 🙋

Agent: Great, let's delve into it. Our “Set-for-Life” plan, for example, has this investment component where a portion of your premium goes to investment funds. This helps in accumulating wealth, which you can use in the future, be it for retirement, upgrading lifestyle, or even emergencies.

Maria: <reflect>That's a smart way of integrating investments with insurance.</reflect>Wow, so it's like hitting two birds with one stone. Sounds better than what I initially thought. 

Agent: Exactly! It’s about making sure every peso you invest works harder for you. Plus, with FWD, we ensure flexibility and transparency in all our dealings. Any other questions bothering you, Maria?

Maria: <reflect>Let’s get him on the cost part. Could be crucial.</reflect>One last thing, Alex. How's the premium compared to other plans in the market? I mean, is it expensive?😣

Agent: Cost is definitely a concern for many. We aim to offer competitive premiums. What's important is the coverage and benefits you get compared to the price. We can customize a plan suited to your budget, without compromising on essential coverage.

Maria: <reflect>Customizable sounds good too. Seems like he’s got answers for everything.</reflect>Hmm, okay, customizable is a good pitch. It does sound less daunting now that you've explained it all.

Agent: I'm glad to hear that. Our goal is to make insurance approachable and beneficial for everyone. Let’s make sure it fits your needs perfectly. 

Maria: <reflect>He really knows his stuff. Learned a lot today.</reflect>Thanks for explaining, Alex. Ang dami ko natutunan today! 🙆
