 Agent: I'm glad we got through all the details. So, Maria, what do you think of the plan?

Maria: <reflect>I need to address the cost since it’s a concern for me.</reflect>Well, I have to be honest, kahit maganda siya, I'm still worried about the cost. The premiums seem too expensive for my budget. 🙅

Agent: I understand where you're coming from, Maria. Premiums can look daunting at first, but think of it this way: you're securing your future. We even have flexible payment options that could make it more manageable. Have you thought about how we can spread out the payments?

Maria: <reflect>He's suggesting flexible payments; but it's still money out of my pocket.</reflect>That's a point, but honestly, I don’t have extra money right now. Better to save money pa rin, iyon ang priority with my current budget. 🙅

Agent: Saving money is crucial, no argument there. But life insurance can act as a safety net, just in case something unexpected happens. It’s like having a rainy-day fund that you hope you never have to use, but it's there just in case. Think of it as part of your financial strategy.

Maria: <reflect>He makes a good point, but I still have expenses to handle.</reflect>I get that idea. Pero, I'm also paying off my loan pa din kasi. Kailangan ko munang unahin yun eh. 🤔

Agent: I see you're being practical, Maria, and that's really important. Did you know some of our plans have critical illness coverage? This can help cover medical expenses, so your loan payments don't get affected in case you get seriously ill. It's like giving future-you a helping hand.

Maria: <reflect>Critical illness coverage sounds good, but I still need to know if I can afford this while paying my loan.</reflect>That does sound useful, in fairness. But honestly, where would the money come from? My salary isn't enough to spend on insurance at the moment. 😢

Agent: That's a valid concern, Maria. I know na sometimes, it feels like an added expense. But consider this: we can tailor a plan to fit your salary. Start with a basic coverage and you can upgrade later as your financial situation improves. Baby steps. 

Maria: <reflect>He's suggesting starting small; might be more doable.</reflect>Hmm, that's something to think about. Pero, paano pagwala na ako ng job? That could complicate things further. 🙅

Agent: Good point, Maria. We actually have provisions for that situation too. Some plans allow you to pause payments for a bit or even have a fund you can use during tough times. It’s all about flexibility while keeping you secure.

Maria: <reflect>Pausing payments sounds helpful; I didn't know that was an option.</reflect>Really? I didn't know I could do that. That's a bit reassuring.🙏

Agent: I'm glad you find it reassuring, Maria. Flexibility is key, especially in times like these. Let’s consider this part of your financial toolkit, something that protects you and your loved ones.

Maria: <reflect>He’s emphasizing on security and toolkit, let's see how it fits in my daily life.</reflect>Okay, but if I’m being honest, will this really give me more peace of mind on a daily basis? 🤔

Agent: That's a fair question. Think of it this way: without insurance, you might save a bit more now, but what if something unexpected happens? The cost could be much higher in terms of stress and finances. Insurance gives a bit of mental comfort knowing you're covered, no matter what happens.

Maria: <reflect>I appreciate the peace of mind aspect, but let’s see if it truly fits.</reflect>You're right. It's more about that peace of mind. I just need everything else to fit together too. 🙆

Agent: Exactly, Maria. It’s about finding that balance. We can set up a personalized consultation for you to see all the options. Pwede natin gawin na it fits comfortably within your financial plan.

Maria: <reflect>Personalized consultation sounds professional and might help clarify things more.</reflect>Alright, a personalized consultation sounds like something I could benefit from. Maybe we can look further into it. 🙆

Agent: That’s great to hear, Maria. We’ll make sure to go through everything step by step, ensuring it fits perfectly within your current situation and future plans. Any other questions you have in mind?

Maria: <reflect>I do have other priorities and I’m still hesitant.<reflect>Just one quick question: are there other benefits aside from the ones we discussed? Like maybe something that would really stand out for someone like me? 🤔

Agent: Great question, Maria. Besides the financial security, some plans offer wellness benefits, even discounts on medical services and gym memberships, which can help you save in other areas of your life too.

Maria: <reflect>Wellness benefits sound appealing; these could offset some costs elsewhere.</reflect>Wow, wellness benefits might actually be a nice bonus. Salamat for bringing that up! 🙆
