 Agent: So, Maria, what do you think about the benefits and features of our policy? Has everything been clear so far?

Maria: <reflect>It's clear, but I'm still not feeling the urgency. I should mention that I'm not in a hurry.</reflect>Yes, Alex, everything's very clear. But you know, I feel like now is not really the best time for me. I mean, it's not urgent. 🙆

Agent: I understand, Maria. A lot of people feel that way. But have you thought about how having insurance now could actually save you a lot of stress in the future? Life can be unpredictable, di ba?

Maria: <reflect>He's talking about the unpredictable nature of life, but honestly, I still think it's not urgent.</reflect>Oh, for sure, life is super unpredictable! But, you know, I'm still young and healthy. I feel like I have plenty of time to worry about things like this. 🤔

Agent: That's good to hear, Maria. Being young and healthy is a blessing. But that's actually the best time to secure insurance. You get better rates and more comprehensive coverages. Think of it as an investment in your future self.

Maria: <reflect>He makes a fair point about it being an investment, but I still have some reservations.</reflect>Okay, I get that. But I'm not married or have kids yet. Parang wala pang urgency to secure a policy. 🤔

Agent: True, you might not have dependents now. But what if you could build a more secure future for yourself? Imagine being covered for unexpected events and not worrying about finances if something happens. It's also about your peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>He's speaking about peace of mind, and while it sounds good, I still think I can wait.</reflect>Well, that's a nice way to put it. But since I'm not supporting anyone with my income, why the rush? 💬

Agent: Understandable, Maria. However, getting insurance isn't just for those you support. It's also about securing your own financial future and avoiding unexpected expenses. Better to be prepared, right?

Maria: <reflect>Certainly, he's making logical points, but I still think there's no immediate need.</reflect>I mean, I get all that, truly. But I still think I can wait until it's more urgent for me. 🙅

Agent: That's a valid concern, Maria. But take a look at it this way: the earlier you get insured, the lesser you pay through the years. Plus, you'd be locking in your health status while you're still fit, making it much easier to get comprehensive coverage.

Maria: <reflect>He keeps emphasizing the financial advantage. I suppose that's practical.</reflect>Okay, the locking in the rates part does sound practical. Pero, isn’t it also good to save money instead? 😅

Agent: Of course, saving is crucial, Maria. But combining savings with insurance ensures that your savings aren't depleted by unexpected medical expenses or other emergencies. It's about striking a balance, really.

Maria: <reflect>He has a point about combining savings and insurance. Maybe I should think about the long-term benefits.</reflect>Hmm, makes sense. Balancing savings and insurance does sound smart. But is it really worth getting it while I'm still so young?

Agent: Absolutely, Maria! Starting young gives you a financial edge. With time on your side, you have the chance to accumulate more benefits without paying through the nose. It’s all about future-proofing your finances.

Maria: <reflect>He's very persistent about starting young. I can see some logic there.</reflect>Fine, you’re pretty persuasive. I can see why it's probably smart to start young. Maayos ang explanation mo talaga.

Agent: Thank you, Maria. I hope that cleared things up a bit. But if you like, I can show you some real-life scenarios where getting insurance early made a huge difference?

Maria: <reflect>He wants to give examples, that might be helpful, but I still feel hesitant about the urgency.</reflect>I think I'll pass on the examples for now. I do appreciate the information you’ve shared. Actually, I’m more curious about how the premiums work over time? 🙏

Agent: Sure thing, Maria. The premiums are designed to be affordable and increase gradually based on your age and the plan you choose. By starting young, you'll benefit from lower initial premiums that grow slowly.
