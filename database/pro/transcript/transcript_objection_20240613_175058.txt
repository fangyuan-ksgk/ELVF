 Agent: And that‚Äôs pretty much the details about the policies we offer here at FWD, Maria. Do any of them sound like they might fit what you‚Äôre looking for?

Maria: <reflect>Okay, balikan ko ulit yung presyo. Mahal kasi.</reflect>Actually, alam mo, ang concern ko talaga is the premium. Parang too expensive for my budget right now.

Agent: I totally understand, and budget concerns are very common. But let me assure you, we have flexible payment plans. Have you thought about how these plans might fit into your budget on a monthly basis rather than annually?

Maria: <reflect>Monthly is still an expense. Let's see what else he says.</reflect>Hmm, kahit monthly, medyo tight pa rin. Right now kasi, I'm still paying off my loan, so ang bigat din sa bulsa.üôÖ

Agent: Of course, loans can be quite a burden. But have you considered how having insurance could actually relieve some of that financial stress in the event of an emergency? It's like a safety net, especially when unexpected expenses come up.

Maria: <reflect>He has a point, pero hindi ko pa rin ma-afford.</reflect>Gets ko naman yan. Pero honestly, wala talagang spare money. Salary ko is not enough to cover the premiums after all other expenses ko.

Agent: I get that it can be really challenging. One option could be starting with a smaller policy and upgrading later. Sometimes just having a bit of coverage is better than none. How does that sound?

Maria: <reflect>Smaller policy? How small? Still doubtful.</reflect>Paano yun? Ano'ng difference ng smaller policy, in terms of coverage and benefits?

Agent: Great question! A smaller policy means lower premiums but still provides essential protection. It can cover basic needs like accidental coverage and life protection at a reduced rate.

Maria: <reflect>That's still another monthly expense. Hmmm.</reflect>Baka kasi it's still better to just save my money in the bank, para sure na may funds ako when needed.

Agent: While saving money in the bank is good, remember that interest rates can be quite low. Insurance offers guaranteed protection and can sometimes provide better security for emergencies than a bank account.

Maria: <reflect>He has a point again, pero I'm still hesitant.</reflect>Sige, pero what if I get sick or need hospitalization? Diba I have HMO for that?

Agent: True, your HMO covers hospitalization but only to a certain extent. Insurance can cover the costs that your HMO might not, giving you more comprehensive protection. 

Maria: <reflect>Kulang pa rin kasi talaga budget ko, di ko ma-stretch.</reflect>Na-get ko naman point mo, Alex, but siguro for now, hindi ko ma-prioritize insurance since mahirap talaga i-stretch yung budget ko.

Agent: I understand your situation, Maria. Flexibility is key. Maybe you can start smaller and increase coverage as your financial situation improves. It‚Äôs all about finding the right balance for you.

Maria: <reflect>I appreciate him being understanding.</reflect>Thank you for understanding, Alex. Baka when I'm more financially stable, then I can seriously consider it. üôè

Agent: Any time, Maria! And remember, we‚Äôre here to help you when you're ready. In the meantime, is there anything else you‚Äôd like to ask or discuss?

Maria: <reflect>Let's see, anything else about insurance that might be useful?</reflect>I think that's all for now about the insurance. Marami ka na-explain. What‚Äôs the most important thing I should remember about all this? ü§î

Agent: The most important thing to remember is that insurance is about peace of mind and protection. It's an investment in your future and your well-being. Our goal is to make sure you and your loved ones are safeguarded against life's uncertainties.

Maria: <reflect>That does resonate with me.</reflect>Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, Alex! üôÜ
