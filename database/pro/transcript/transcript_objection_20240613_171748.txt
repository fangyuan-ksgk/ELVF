 Agent: Alright Maria, I've shared all the details about our insurance policies. Any thoughts so far? 

Maria: <reflect>I like what he presented, but I still have trust issues.</reflect>Kasi, I've heard about FWD nga, but honestly, it's still a new name for me. I want to hear something para to convince me na legit kayo. 🤔

Agent: Ah, I understand. FWD might be new here in the Philippines, but we're already making waves globally. We're part of a group founded in Asia by Richard Li, and we're committed to changing the way people feel about insurance. How does that sound?

Maria: <reflect>He sounds confident. But let's dig deeper into my concerns.</reflect>Okay, pero isn't it true that new companies sometimes increase premiums without clear reasons? I mean, nangyayari ba yun sakin later on? 🤔

Agent: I'm glad you asked, Maria. At FWD, transparency is key to our service. Any premium adjustments would be communicated well in advance and for valid reasons, such as changes in market conditions. We aim to keep your trust by being clear and upfront.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, that sounds good but I have one more trust issue to address.</reflect>Mmm, I also read somewhere na you can't adjust the policy once it's set. Parang, pano naman yun pag may changes sa life situation ko in the future? 🤔

Agent: Great question, Maria. Actually, we offer flexible policies that can be adjusted based on your changing needs. Whether you have a new dependent, career change, or any other significant life event, our policies are designed to accommodate these changes. You won't be stuck with the same terms forever.

Maria: <reflect>He's covering my concerns well. Maybe I'll ask about a different aspect next.</reflect>Alright, but could you tell me more about the kind of customer service I can expect? 🤔

Agent: Of course. At FWD, we pride ourselves on our customer-centric approach. We have a dedicated support team available 24/7 to help you with any questions or issues you might have. We also offer digital solutions for easy access to your policy information anytime, anywhere.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, that sounds convenient. Service is crucial for me.</reflect>Customer-centric is good, gusto ko yun. How about responding time? Diba minsan super tagal ng response ng ibang companies? 🙅

Agent: That's another point where we stand out. Our goal is to respond swiftly to all inquiries within 24 hours. We understand the importance of timely communication and are committed to providing quick and efficient service.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds promising. I should ask about something a bit different now.</reflect>Okay, ano pa kaya ang ibang benefits beyond the basic coverage? 🙆

Agent: I'm glad you asked, Maria. Aside from the basic coverage, we offer add-ons like critical illness riders, hospital income riders, and even accidental death benefits. These can be customized based on your specific concerns and lifestyle. This flexibility ensures you’re getting the coverage that best fits your needs.

Maria: <reflect>Sounds good. Let me dig a bit deeper into another aspect.</reflect>What about payment options? Mahirap ba siya i-manage?🙏

Agent: We understand the need for convenience, Maria. So, we've provided various payment options, including online bank transfers, auto-debit arrangements, and even mobile payment solutions. Managing your insurance payments has never been easier!

Maria: <reflect>They've really put thought into this. Let's see about immediate requirements.</reflect>Okay, and do I need any medical exams to get started?🤔

Agent: Good question, Maria! While some policies might require a medical exam, we also have several that don't. It really depends on the type of coverage you're looking for and your overall health. But don’t worry, we will guide you through it all.

Maria: <reflect>That removes one barrier. Man, they've covered almost everything.</reflect>Sobrang laking tulong nun, especially for busy people like me. Okay, so how would you summarize FWD in one sentence? 🙆

Agent: That's a fun challenge! I’d say, FWD is all about making insurance uncomplicated, accessible, and responsive to your ever-changing needs. We aim to provide peace of mind in a fast-paced world.

Maria: <reflect>That's an impressive tagline. I'm almost convinced.</reflect>Ganda ng summary! So far, so good. What's one fun fact about FWD that's not widely known? 🙆

Agent: Fun fact? Alright, here goes! Our parent company was inspired by the technology and innovation trends in Asia, so we integrate a lot of tech-savvy elements into our service. For example, we have an app where you can manage all your insurance details with just a few taps!

Maria: <reflect>Tech-savvy is fun. I like that.</reflect>Wow, that sounds super convenient! Especially for someone like me who's always on my phone. 🙆

Agent: Exactly! We're all about making things easier for you. Is there anything else you'd like to know or any other concerns that I can address for you?

Maria: <reflect>He's been really thorough. Let's see what else might come up.</reflect>I guess I'm just curious about one last thing, how do you ensure fairness in claims processing?🙏

Agent: Our claims process is designed to be as transparent and straightforward as possible. We have a dedicated claims team that reviews each case carefully to ensure fairness and objectivity. Plus, we provide clear guidelines to help you understand what's required, reducing the back-and-forth and speeding up the entire process.

Maria: <reflect>They're covering all bases well. I feel more reassured.</reflect>Got it. That's really reassuring, actually. 🙆
