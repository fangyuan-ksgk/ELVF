 Agent: So Maria, how are you finding the coverage that we've discussed so far?

Maria: <reflect>Now that we're talking numbers, I need to address my concerns about cost.</reflect>Ah, it's quite interesting naman, but there's just something I need to mention. Premiums are too expensive for my budget, especially since I'm still paying off my loan. 🤔

Agent: I understand, Maria. Budgeting can be really tough, especially with loans to consider. But think of insurance as a safety net; it protects you and your family from unexpected expenses that might end up costing more in the long run.

Maria: <reflect>His point is valid, but I still have to manage my monthly budget.</reflect>Well, I see your point, pero right now, my salary is really not enough to spend on insurance. 🙅

Agent: That’s fair, Maria. We have flexible payment options that can fit more comfortably within your budget. Plus, consider the long-term savings on medical bills and other expenses that insurance can cover.

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility sounds good, but I still need to justify this expense.</reflect>Even with flexible payments, it's still an extra cost. Insurance just doesn’t seem like a priority in my budget right now.🤔

Agent: I hear you, Maria. But what if we look at it this way? By having insurance, you preserve your savings and assets. It ensures that you won’t have to break into your emergency fund or sell off assets in case of any health emergencies.

Maria: <reflect>That does make sense, but I’m still worried about the upfront cost.</reflect>Hmm, well, I'd rather save money in the bank to earn interest. 💬

Agent: That’s definitely one way to grow your money, but remember, bank savings don't provide financial protection. Insurance adds that layer of security that a traditional savings account can’t.

Maria: <reflect>He's making a good point, but the cost is still a hurdle.</reflect>Okay, you're right, but hindi ba what you're offering me still mahal? 🙏

Agent: It might seem costly upfront, but think about the peace of mind and security it provides. Whenever you're faced with unexpected situations, you’ll be glad you have that coverage.

Maria: <reflect>He's pushing the idea of security and peace of mind.</reflect>Sige, I get it. But I heard that premiums are expensive talaga, and with my current financial status, medyo mahirap pa. 🙅

Agent: What we can do is work together to tailor a plan that won’t be too heavy on your wallet. We can start with a basic plan and adjust it once your financial situation improves.

Maria: <reflect>He’s really willing to work around my budget, which is good.</reflect>Hmm, I do like the idea of starting small. Pero, what if I really can’t afford even the basic plan right now? 💬

Agent: If budget remains tight, we can re-evaluate and find a temporary solution. Our goal is to ensure that you're still protected even at a minimal cost.

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility is reassuring, but I'm still on the fence.</reflect>I appreciate the effort to work around my budget, pero I need some time to think about it. 🤔

Agent: Of course, Maria. Take your time. This is a big decision, and it's important that you're comfortable with it. Can you share what other financial priorities you have right now?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to understand my situation more, I should share.</reflect>Well, besides my loan, I also have to save for some family expenses and emergency fund allocations. 🙏

Agent: Those are all essential, Maria. Insurance can also be seen as part of your broader financial planning, ensuring that other priorities don’t get derailed by unforeseen circumstances.

Maria: <reflect>It’s really about long-term security, isn’t it?</reflect>I see your point. It's really about securing my financial future, right? 🤔

Agent: Exactly, Maria. It’s about creating a financial safety net that supports your future goals and current responsibilities. 

Maria: <reflect>This conversation is actually helpful in understanding my financial planning.</reflect>Alright, you’ve given me a lot to think about. Let me mull over this. 🙏

Agent: I’m really glad to have had this talk with you, Maria. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, I’m always here to help.

Maria: <reflect>This agent is quite accommodating, which is nice.</reflect>Thank you for your patience and for explaining everything clearly. 🤔

Agent: Any time, Maria. It’s my pleasure to help in any way I can.
