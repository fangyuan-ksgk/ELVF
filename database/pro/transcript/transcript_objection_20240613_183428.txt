 Agent: So, Maria, we've gone through the main benefits of the policy, and I'm glad you're really understanding all the details. What do you think so far?

Maria: <reflect>I need to state my main objection first before anything else</reflect>Well, it's very comprehensive. But to be honest, I think I don't really need it. My partner already has life insurance, so I feel like we’re covered. 🙆

Agent: I understand, Maria. Life insurance for both partners can actually provide additional peace of mind. It's not just about coverage; it's about ensuring that both of you have financial security, should anything unexpected happen. What’s more, having your own policy means you’re also thinking of your personal future and responsibilities.

Maria: <reflect>He makes a point but still I don't feel convinced</reflect>Okay, that does make sense somehow. But, if I'm being honest, I don't really believe in insurance. 🙅

Agent: I totally get where you're coming from. Investing in insurance can seem unnecessary until you actually need it. But look at it this way—it’s like wearing a seatbelt. You don’t expect to need it every day, but it saves lives when the unexpected happens. It’s a safety net for you and your loved ones.

Maria: <reflect>His analogy is quite clever but I'm not sold on it just yet</reflect>I guess that analogy works... but I still feel it's an unnecessary expense. I think I’m saving enough on my own po. 🤔

Agent: That’s very responsible of you to have a savings plan in place, Maria. However, insurance isn't just about savings; it’s about protection. Even the best savings might not cover unexpected medical bills or loss of income. This policy could complement your savings, offering additional support when you need it the most.

Maria: <reflect>He's coming up with decent reasons. I should see if the policy has no expensive pricing</reflect>Alright, maybe. But isn’t it expensive to have these policies po? I don’t want to overpay for coverage I don’t need. 🙏

Agent: I’m so glad you asked that, Maria. At FWD, we have flexible payment options and plans that can be tailored to fit your budget and specific needs. It’s all about making sure you don’t pay for what you don’t need, while still getting valuable protection.

Maria: <reflect>Flexible options are good, let's see if there are any more hidden catches</reflect>Hmmm... flexible payment sounds good. But how do I know I'm not getting coverage I won't use?

Agent: Great question, Maria! During our assessment, we take your specific circumstances into account, ensuring that the policy you get is exactly what you need. We don’t believe in one-size-fits-all—we tailor it specifically for you.

Maria: <reflect>If it's tailored, maybe they can adjust as needs change</reflect>Okay, that’s more reassuring. Can we adjust the policy if my needs change in the future?

Agent: Absolutely, Maria! Our plans are designed to be flexible. If your circumstances change, say, you get married or have kids, we can adjust your policy to better suit your needs. This ensures you’re always properly covered without unnecessary expenses.

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility and adjustments are convenient. Maybe there's something specific about family coverage</reflect>That’s good to know. How about if we have kids in the future, will the policy cover them too? 🙆

Agent: Yes, we can include riders for children within the policy. It’s an added layer of protection for your entire family, making sure that everyone is covered under one plan.

Maria: <reflect>That seems like a real benefit, but I still need to think </reflect>It sounds really comprehensive. But I think I need more time to think about it. I usually discuss big decisions like this with my partner po. 🤔

Agent: I respect that, Maria. It's important to make such decisions with your loved ones. Is there any other information you’d like me to provide or discuss further to help you make a more informed decision?

Maria: <reflect>I want to know how they handle claims</reflect>Actually, how hassle-free is the claims process? I've heard some insurance companies make it very complicated 🙆

Agent: That’s a valid concern, Maria. We pride ourselves on having a straightforward and easy claims process. We have a dedicated team to assist you and ensure it's as stress-free as possible. We know the last thing you need during difficult times is more stress.

Maria: <reflect>This is reassuring but still want to ensure how often they approve claims</reflect>That’s good to hear. What's your approve rate on claims, though? 🙆

Agent: We have a high approval rate, Maria. Our goal is to be there when our clients need us the most. As long as all the required documentation is provided, there shouldn't be any issues with claim approval. 

Maria: <reflect>That's reassuring, but still, my partner's views are very important</reflect>Thank you for clarifying that. I'll definitely need to discuss this with my partner and think it over. 🙏

Agent: Of course, Maria. Take your time, and if you have any more questions, feel free to reach out. It was wonderful talking to you today. 

Maria: <reflect>He’s polite. I should express my appreciation</reflect>Thank you, it was really informative. I appreciate your time and patience po. 🙏
