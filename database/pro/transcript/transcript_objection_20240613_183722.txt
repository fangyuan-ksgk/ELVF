 Agent: So Maria, now that we've gone through all the details of the policy, what do you think? Any questions or concerns?

Maria: <reflect>I'll bring up my main reservation about unnecessary expenses.</reflect>Well, you know, Alex, I still think that getting life insurance is an unnecessary expense for me. I already have an emergency fund and I'm in good health. 🤔

Agent: I totally understand where you're coming from, Maria. But the thing with life insurance is that it provides an additional layer of security that an emergency fund alone might not cover. For instance, if something unexpected happens, your family won't have to dip into that fund.

Maria: <reflect>He makes a point, but I still wonder about overpaying for coverage I might not need.</reflect>Hmm, that does make sense, but I'm also worried about overpaying for coverage I might not actually need. 🙆

Agent: Great observation! We can tailor the insurance plan to fit exactly what you need and nothing more. That way, you won't feel like you're spending on something unnecessary. Plus, we can review and adjust it periodically.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, he's flexible, but I have assets that could serve the same purpose.</reflect>Well, I have some assets that I think could serve the same purpose as life insurance. Do you think life insurance is still necessary when you have assets? 🙅

Agent: That's a great question, Maria. While assets are fantastic, life insurance provides liquidity, ensuring that your loved ones can access funds immediately without having to sell or liquidate assets, which could take time and may not be at favorable conditions.

Maria: <reflect>Alright, liquidity is a good point. But still...</reflect>I see. I'm just trying to be smart with my finances dito, so I'm still not fully convinced.🙆

Agent: I can see you're very sensible with your finances, Maria. One of the main benefits of life insurance is the peace of mind it brings. Knowing that your family is protected no matter what can be worth much more than the policy itself.

Maria: <reflect>Peace of mind sounds good, but I still have another reservation.</reflect>That's true, but I'd rather invest the money instead. Don't you think investments can be just as good, if not better?🙅

Agent: Investments are indeed important, but they come with their own set of risks. Life insurance is more about providing a safety net that isn't subject to market fluctuations. It's like having both—you're covered on pretty much all fronts.

Maria: <reflect>He's making sense, but I've been managing well on my own without insurance.</reflect>Makes sense. But you know, I've been doing quite well managing my own finances without insurance, so I'm still torn. 🙆

Agent: I understand, Maria. You're clearly good with your finances, but think of life insurance as an additional tool in your toolkit. It's there to handle what your current strategies might miss, providing a comprehensive safety net.

Maria: <reflect>An additional tool might be beneficial, I'll admit.</reflect>Hmm, okay, I see your point. So how do you specifically tailor it to match someone's needs?💬

Agent: Good question! What we do is conduct a thorough needs assessment. We'll evaluate your financial situation, goals, and existing plans. Based on that, we craft a policy that fits your lifestyle and future plans perfectly.

Maria: <reflect>That's a sensible approach, I admit.</reflect>Alright, that sounds sensible. So, can it be adjusted over time as my needs change?🤔

Agent: Absolutely, it can. Life is unpredictable, and your policy can evolve with your needs. We review it periodically to make sure it stays relevant to your situation.

Maria: <reflect>Periodic reviews are a good feature.</reflect>Okay, periodic reviews sound good. What kind of benefits can my family expect should anything happen? 🙆

Agent: In case of unfortunate events, your beneficiaries will receive a lump sum payment, which can cover immediate expenses like mortgages, loans, or daily living costs. It can be a huge relief during emotionally and financially stressful times.

Maria: <reflect>That's a significant benefit.</reflect>Alright, I can see how that would be a big help. So, what are the next steps if I decide to go forward with it?👍

Agent: The next steps involve filling out a quick application form and undergoing a free medical examination. Afterward, we'll customize your policy based on the results and your preferences. Are you ready to get started?
