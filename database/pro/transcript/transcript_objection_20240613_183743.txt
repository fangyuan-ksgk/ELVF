 Agent: So, Maria, now that we've gone through all the details of the policy, do you have any questions or concerns about getting life insurance?

Maria: <reflect>Medyo hesitant ako kasi parang di practical. Let me express those.)</reflect>Actually, I have some concerns. For one, I'd rather just invest the money instead. Investment seems more beneficial in the long run, diba? 🤔

Agent: I understand where you're coming from, Maria. Investing money is indeed beneficial. But one thing to consider is that life insurance can offer a layer of security that investments alone can't. For instance, if something unfortunate happens, insurance can provide financial support immediately.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, but if I have assets, maybe I don't need so much coverage. Mention assets.)</reflect>True, but I already have some assets. I think relying on those for any emergencies makes sense, right?💬

Agent: Having assets is definitely a good safety net. However, life insurance is designed to offer immediate liquidity in critical times, which assets might not. It ensures that your loved ones can access funds quickly without waiting for asset liquidation or facing market fluctuations.

Maria: <reflect>Well, I also have a managed emergency fund. Bring up emergency fund.)</reflect>I get that, but I also have my own well-managed emergency fund. So paying for insurance feels like an extra, unnecessary expense.🙆

Agent: It's great that you have an emergency fund, Maria. That's commendable! But insurance can complement that by offering long-term planning and support for unexpected events that might deplete your emergency fund, like medical expenses or major life changes. It ensures your emergency fund remains intact for other uses.

Maria: <reflect>Interesting points, medyo convincing.)</reflect>I see what you mean. But what if I'm healthy and relatively young? It feels like an unnecessary expense now. 😅

Agent: Being young and healthy certainly gives you some advantages. However, being proactive and getting insurance now while you're in good health typically means lower premiums. It's more expensive to start later. Think of insurance as preventive, like exercising or eating right.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, valid. What about the cost?)</reflect>Okay, that makes sense. But I'm worried about overpaying for coverage I might not need.🙅

Agent: It's a valid concern. At FWD, we have customizable plans that allow you to pay only for what you truly need, so you're not overspending. Plus, the coverage can adapt as your life changes, ensuring you're not locked into something that doesn't fit your future.

Maria: <reflect>He has tailored options, should explore more.)</reflect>Interesting, customizable plans. But honestly, I also consult my financial advisor for these decisions.🙏

Agent: That's fantastic, Maria. Having a financial advisor on your side is a great strategy. Many of our clients actually work with both us and their advisors to make sure they're fully covered from all angles. It's all about having a holistic approach to financial health.

Maria: <reflect>Sounds comprehensive, integrate advice.)</reflect>True, a comprehensive approach does sound logical. Maybe this could complement what I'm already doing.🙆

Agent: Exactly! It’s all about enhancing what you have. Life insurance acts as an added layer of protection, not a replacement for your investments or emergency funds. It’s another piece of the financial puzzle that can offer peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>He's quite convincing, I'll bite a little.)</reflect>I guess it’s worth considering. But what if my needs change, like I get married or have kids? 🤔

Agent: Great question, Maria. Our plans are flexible and can be adjusted as your life circumstances change. Whether you get married, have kids, or even if your career changes, the policy can evolve with you. You’re never stuck with a one-size-fits-all solution.

Maria: <reflect>Reasonable responses, should probe more.)</reflect>Yun nga, flexibility is important for me. What other benefits does FWD offer that I might not find elsewhere? 💬

Agent: Aside from customizable plans, we offer comprehensive health and wellness benefits, including telemedicine services, wellness check-ups, and even mental health support. We believe that insurance should support your overall well-being and not just act as a financial safety net.

Maria: <reflect>Impressive, but let’s not rush.)</reflect>Impressive benefits pero, let’s dig deeper pagdating sa cost. What's the usual range I can expect for premiums? 🙆

Agent: The premium range can vary greatly depending on your needs, age, and health status. However, we offer tailored plans to fit various budgets. We could run some numbers based on your specific details to give you a clearer idea.

Maria: <reflect>Parang practical naman. Continue the topic.)</reflect>Practical naman siya, but let’s make sure it fits within my budget constraints. Can you outline the process for customizing a plan? 🙏

Agent: Definitely, Maria. First, we would assess your current financial situation, future goals, and any specific needs you have. From there, we can suggest the best policy options, discuss premium costs, and adjust coverage as needed. It’s all about fitting it perfectly to your life.
