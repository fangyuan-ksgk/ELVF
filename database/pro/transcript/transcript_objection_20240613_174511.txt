 Agent: Thank you for taking the time to meet with me, Maria. Now that we've gone through the details of our insurance policies, do you have any questions or concerns?

Maria: <reflect>There are several concerns I have in mind, but I should start with the money issue first.</reflect>Kamusta, finally nice to meet you! You know, I've been thinking about our discussion, but honestly, saving money is more important to me right now. These days, it's tough to stretch the budget.

Agent: I totally understand, Maria. Budgeting is crucial. Have you considered that insurance can actually be a form of forced savings? Over time, it builds up and can prove beneficial, lalo na in emergencies or future financial needs.

Maria: <reflect>He's making a good point, but my income is still an issue.</reflect>Sige, but the thing is, my salary isn't enough to spend on insurance right now. I'm already juggling bills, rent, and everyday expenses. 🙅

Agent: I hear you, Maria. Timing is everything, and our policies are quite flexible. We can adjust them to fit within your current budget. Even a minimal investment can provide you with essential protection and peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility sounds good, but the premiums might still be steep.</reflect>Well, I've heard that the premiums for good coverage can be pretty expensive. Is there any way to make them more affordable without compromising on benefits?🤔

Agent: That's a very common concern, and I'm glad you brought it up. At FWD, we offer customized plans that let you choose the level of coverage you need and can afford. Plus, we regularly review your policy to ensure it continues to meet your needs and budget.

Maria: <reflect>He seems to have answers for everything; I wonder about hidden fees.</reflect>Interesting. But you know what? I'm always cautious about hidden fees. How can I be sure I'm not overpaying for something I don't need? 🙆

Agent: Great question, Maria. Transparency is key for us. All our fees and charges are clearly outlined in the policy documents. You can also discuss any doubts with me anytime, and I'll ensure you have complete clarity before making any decisions.

Maria: <reflect>He seems sincere, but I'm still worried about future expenses.</reflect>That's comforting to hear. But still, what if unforeseen expenses come up, like hospital bills or emergencies? How will I manage to pay the premiums?🙏

Agent: Another excellent point. We offer premium holiday options where you can temporarily stop making payments while still keeping your coverage, just in case you face any financial difficulties. It's like a safety net for your insurance policy.

Maria: <reflect>Flexible options are promising, but what benefits are there if nothing happens to me? 🤔</reflect>Wow, that's interesting! But what about if nothing serious happens to me? It might feel like I'm putting money down the drain. 🙆

Agent: I totally get that concern, Maria. Think of it this way: insurance is like having an umbrella. You hope it never rains, but it's there to protect you if it does. Plus, some of our policies come with investment components. Even if you don’t make a claim, your money is growing with the plan.

Maria: <reflect>That's reassuring. Maybe I'll consider it but still need more info to be sure.🤔</reflect>Okay, that makes sense. But I still have to think about it carefully. You know, really weigh my options. How long do I have to decide? 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, take your time, Maria. There's no rush. You can reach out to me anytime if you have more questions or need further details. I’m here to help you make an informed decision when you're ready. 

Maria: <reflect>Nice, he's not pushing too hard. I appreciate that.</reflect>Thanks for understanding, and for not pushing me to decide instantly. It's refreshing to have someone actually listen. 🙆

Agent: I believe in a no-pressure approach, Maria. Making a sound financial decision should be stress-free. Would you like any more information or examples to help with your decision-making process?

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, examples could help give me a clearer picture.</reflect>Yes, maybe a few examples would be helpful. Like real-life situations where insurance made a big difference.🤔

Agent: Certainly, Maria. Let's take a simple example. Imagine if, God forbid, something happens and you can't work for several months. Your insurance policy can provide you with a monthly income to cover your living expenses, so you don't have to deplete your savings.

Maria: <reflect>That example is quite relatable; it's definitely making me think.</reflect>That scenario hits close to home. So basically, the policy steps in when I can't. That's reassuring. 🙆

Agent: Exactly. And it's not just about protecting you, but your loved ones as well. When everything's stable, you might not realize the need, but unforeseen events can change things quickly. Having that safety net can be a huge relief.

Maria: <reflect>He's definitely giving me a lot to think about.</reflect>You’re right. There's a lot to consider. I'll definitely think this over seriously. It's a big decision, of course. 🙏

Agent: Of course. I'm here for any questions you might have, whenever they pop up. Just let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you further.

Maria: <reflect>He seems really supportive and not pushy. I appreciate that.</reflect>Thanks, I appreciate your support and patience. It really helps having someone guide me through this.🙆
