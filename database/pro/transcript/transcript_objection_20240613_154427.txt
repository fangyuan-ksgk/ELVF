 Agent: Thanks for listening to the details, Maria. So, what do you think about our policies?

Maria: <reflect>Time to bring up my doubts about this company</reflect>Hmm, I've heard about FWD being a new company. Can you tell me more about it?🤔

Agent: That's a common question, Maria. FWD is relatively new in the country, but we're a part of the Pacific Century Group which has a solid track record. We're different because we focus on innovation and customer-centric services. Have you heard of our parent company? 

Maria: <reflect>He's mentioning a parent company, I should see if that's trustworthy</reflect>Oh, okay. I haven't really heard much about Pacific Century Group either. What can you tell me about them?🤔

Agent: Ah, they’re based in Hong Kong and have been around for decades, focusing not just on insurance but also in telecommunications and media. So, they're quite established in Asia. 

Maria: <reflect>Sounds legit but still need some assurance</reflect>Interesting, but isn't better to buy from someone I know personally?🤔

Agent: I totally understand where you're coming from. We all want to feel comfortable with our choices. Our team is dedicated to building that trust with you. Plus, we have excellent customer service you can always rely on. 

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to address my worries about trust. But I still want to compare with other companies</reflect>Well, I also want to compare products from other companies to be sure. 🙆

Agent: That's a smart move, Maria. I encourage my clients to explore their options. It gives peace of mind and helps you make a well-informed decision. At the end of the day, it’s all about what's best for you and your family.

Maria: <reflect>He seems genuine, might give it another thought</reflect>You’re right. But what if the premium suddenly increases without clear reason? 🤔

Agent: That’s a valid concern, definitely. At FWD, we strive to be transparent about any changes to premiums. If there ever are adjustments, you will be informed well in advance, and there will be clear reasons behind it.

Maria: <reflect>He’s reassuring, but I’ve yet to be completely convinced</reflect>I’ll need some time to think it over. Baka I also prefer doing my research first, you know? 😬

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Take your time to review and compare. Just remember, I’m here to answer any questions you might have during your research. 

Maria: <reflect>At least he’s not pushy, that’s good</reflect>Okay, everything sounds good naman. Just need to digest all the info muna.🙆

Agent: Totally get it, it’s a lot to take in! So, just out of curiosity, what would be your priority if you were to choose an insurance policy? 

Maria: <reflect>He’s trying to understand my needs, that’s nice</reflect>Oo nga, siguro protection para sa family ko and yung mga emergency situations. 🙆

Agent: That makes sense and it’s a great priority to have. We have plans that specifically cater to that. Should you need detailed comparisons or any specific queries, just let me know. 

Maria: <reflect>Agent is really trying to be helpful, appreciate that</reflect>I’ll definitely keep that in mind, maybe I'll do some more research about your company later.🙆

Agent: Sure, you can visit our website or even check customer reviews online. They provide good insights as well.

Maria: <reflect>I've heard a lot, should ask something more focused now</reflect>Sige, Alex. Quick question lang, how easy is it to adjust a policy later if my needs change? 🤔

Agent: Great question! We offer flexible plans where you can make adjustments as needed. It’s one of the features our clients appreciate most.

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility is a good point</reflect>That’s reassuring to hear. You'll never know when you might need changes.🙏

Agent: Exactly, life is unpredictable. We need to adapt as we go. So, any other concerns I can help clear up at this point?

Maria: <reflect>No more objections for now, maybe just refocus on information</reflect>Nothing new for now. Thanks for all the details! I’ll take my time to decide.🙆
