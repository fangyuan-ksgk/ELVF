 Agent: So, what do you think, Maria? We've gone through all the features of our life insurance policy. I really think this could be beneficial for you.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, I get the benefits, but I think I have some strong points to address.</reflect>You know, Alex, while everything is indeed impressive, I'm still a bit hesitant. For one, my partner already has life insurance.👐

Agent: That's actually great! But, just so you know, having your own policy ensures that you have specific coverage tailored to your personal needs. It also gives you double security in case of unexpected events for both of you.

Maria: <reflect>Alright, that's a decent point, but let me bring up another concern.</reflect>Well, another thing is, I believe I'm saving enough. I have my own emergency fund, so I think I'm covered.🤔

Agent: I understand where you're coming from, Maria. Saving is really good, but insurance acts as a safety net for situations that savings might not cover entirely. It ensures you and your family can maintain your lifestyle even during tough times.

Maria: <reflect>He's good at countering my points, but one more objection to see how he handles it.</reflect>I see. But, honestly, I think it would be better for me to invest the money. Investing can provide better returns.💬

Agent: That's true, Maria. Investments are indeed valuable, but they come with risks. Insurance is there to ensure that you have a guaranteed fallback, which doesn’t change regardless of market conditions. It complements your investment strategy, providing you with peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, now he's making more sense. It's somehow fitting into my picture.</reflect>I get what you're saying. Actually, do you have examples of how this policy has helped others in real-life situations? 🙆

Agent: Yes, absolutely. Just recently, one of my clients had a serious medical emergency. Because they had insurance, they didn’t have to dip into their investments or savings, and their family didn't face financial turmoil.

Maria: <reflect>Personal stories are powerful. Maybe I should listen a bit more.</reflect>That does sound like a big help. But I guess my main worry is overpaying for coverage I don't need. Do you have plans that are more tailored? 🤔

Agent: Definitely, Maria! We offer customizable plans where you can choose the specific coverage and benefits according to your needs. This ensures that you’re not paying for something unnecessary.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, I need to understand more about customization options.</reflect>How exactly can I customize my plan? Like, will I have control over the premium amounts and benefits?🙆

Agent: Exactly, you can choose the amount of coverage you need, the term of the policy, and you can add riders for additional benefits, like critical illness coverage, if you see fit.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, this customization option sounds more appealing now.</reflect>That sounds more adaptable to my needs. Could you walk me through an example of how one might customize their policy?💬

Agent: Sure, let's say you're particularly concerned about critical illness. You could add a rider specifically for that, ensuring higher coverage in such an event, while adjusting other areas to keep your premiums manageable.

Maria: <reflect>Seems reasonable. I should clarify again. </reflect>Interesting, so I can basically adjust based on what's a priority for me at the moment, right?.

Agent: Exactly. It's all about giving you the flexibility to create a plan that fits seamlessly into your life and financial goals.

Maria: <reflect>I'm understanding now, and it seems valuable. </reflect>This actually sounds beneficial the more we talk about it. Is there an option to update the policy as my needs change over time?.

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. You can reevaluate and adjust your coverage as your life circumstances and needs change. Our policies are meant to grow with you.

Maria: <reflect>It's something to think about, but still. </reflect>Understandable. I'll have to give it a good thought. But so far, it seems promising.🙆
