 Agent: So, Maria, with all the details laid out, how do you feel about our life insurance plans? Any thoughts or questions so far?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking for my opinion on the plans. Time to bring up my objections.</reflect>Hmm, well, Alex, honestly, I feel like I don't need life insurance. My partner already has life insurance, and we think it's enough for both of us. 🙅

Agent: I understand where you're coming from, Maria. Having a partner with life insurance is great, but the thing is, it's always safer to have a policy for yourself. It ensures that you're both covered individually, just in case, di ba?

Maria: <reflect>He makes a point, but I should bring up another objection I have.</reflect>Well, I’ve also been thinking, Alex, rather than spending money on insurance, wouldn't it be better if I just invest the money elsewhere? 🙆

Agent: That's a common thought, Maria. Investments definitely have their benefits, but life insurance offers a unique kind of security. It’s like a safety net that ensures your loved ones aren't left in a financial mess if anything happens. Isn't that worth considering?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to address my concern, but let's mention another of my objections.</reflect>I get that, Alex, but really, I think I'm saving enough on my own. We have a solid emergency fund in place. 🤔

Agent: A solid emergency fund is great to have, Maria. But life insurance can act as an extra layer of protection. Think of it as a financial backup to your backup. Plus, it offers benefits like peace of mind and tax advantages. Doesn't that sound reassuring?

Maria: <reflect>He's persistent, and his points are valid. But I'm still not completely convinced.</reflect>Okay, Alex, I see where you're coming from. But I'm also healthy and I don’t see the need to spend on something I might not use.🙆

Agent: Being healthy now is definitely a blessing, Maria. But we can't predict the future, can we? Life insurance is about preparing for the unforeseen. It's like a safety blanket that stays with you no matter what. It’s better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. 

Maria: <reflect>He’s really pushing, making some good points. But I still have my reservations.</reflect>You do have a point, Alex. But how can I be sure I'm not overpaying for something I don't need?

Agent: Excellent question, Maria! Our plans are customizable, so you only pay for what you actually need. We can tweak the coverage and the premium to fit your budget and lifestyle perfectly. Does that sound like something worth exploring? 

Maria: <reflect>Customizable plans do sound more appealing. He’s making it harder to object.</reflect>That does sound better, but what about the hassle of managing it all? Won’t it be too complicated? 🙆

Agent: Not at all, Maria. With our plans, you'll have access to a dedicated advisor, like me, who will help you manage everything. Plus, we have a user-friendly app that makes policy management a breeze. Isn't that convenient?

Maria: <reflect>The advisor help and user-friendly app are nice touches. He's making it difficult to find reasons to say no.</reflect>You seem to have an answer for everything, Alex! But, there must be hidden costs here or there. How transparent is FWD about the actual expenses? 🙏

Agent: Glad you asked, Maria. FWD believes in complete transparency. You'll get a detailed breakdown of all costs involved right from the start. No hidden fees or surprises. Does that ease your concern a bit?

Maria: <reflect>He’s really leaving no room for doubt. Still, I want to be sure.</reflect>It does make it sound less intimidating. But, what happens if I want to cancel the policy later on? Are there any penalties? 🤔

Agent: Another good question, Maria. Our policies have flexible terms. If ever you decide to cancel, there are minimal to no penalties, depending on the policy duration and terms you choose. Shouldn't that make it easier?

Maria: <reflect>Minimal penalties sound good. He's very thorough with his answers.</reflect>I must say, Alex, you’re quite convincing! But I still need some time to think it over. Surely you understand?💬

Agent: Absolutely, Maria! It’s important to take your time and make a well-informed decision. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out anytime. Does that work for you?

Maria: <reflect>He's being considerate and not pushy. That’s good.</reflect>Thanks, Alex. I appreciate that. I will definitely think about it more and let you know. 😇
