 Agent: It's really been informative chatting with you, Maria. Just to recap, we've discussed the different policies FWD offers, including their unique benefits and features. Do you have any questions or concerns at this point?

Maria: <reflect>I have some concerns that need addressing before I commit.</reflect>Well, Alex, I have some concerns. First of all, what is FWD? Parang it's a new company, right? 🤔

Agent: I understand your concern. FWD might be relatively new in the Philippines, but globally, we've been around for quite some time. We are backed by one of the largest investment firms in the world, and we've gained a solid reputation for innovation in the insurance industry. Actually, here in the Philippines, we're growing rapidly because we focus on customer needs and innovative products.

Maria: <reflect>That answers some of my doubt, but I still need reassurance.</reflect>Hmm, okay, I see. But I have not heard of FWD before. How do I know na trustworthy kayo? 🙆

Maria: <reflect>That's good to know but there's still the issue of potential hidden costs.</reflect>I guess that helps. Pero, I've heard about premium increases without clear reasons from other insurance companies. How does FWD address this? 🤔

Agent: Good question, Maria. At FWD, we're committed to transparency. Any changes in premiums are communicated to our clients well in advance and are explained in detail. We ensure that our clients understand the reasons behind any adjustments. Plus, our premium structure is designed to be competitive and stable.

Maria: <reflect>He's very thorough. I need to see if their customer service is as good as he says it is.</reflect>That's quite detailed. How's your customer service? I've heard some companies are hard to reach kapag may problem. 💬
