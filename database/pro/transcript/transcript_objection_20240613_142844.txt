 Maria: <reflect>I need to let him know my hesitation; I should be clear and keep it light.</reflect>Well, Alex, everything sounds interesting, but you know, I really think I need to discuss this with my family muna. It's not that urgent for us right now.🙆

Agent: Totally understandable, Maria. Making a decision like this talagang dapat pag-usapan with family. Pero, let me ask, are there specific concerns or questions iyong family might have na I can help address?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking about my family's concerns; I should mention it's not a priority.</reflect>Wala naman specific concerns, it's just that right now, hindi siya priority for us, especially since we're all pretty healthy pa naman.🤔

Agent: That makes sense. Pero you know, Maria, sometimes being proactive can really benefit you in the long run. Starting early means lower premiums and more savings eventually. 

Maria: <reflect>He mentioned savings; I should show some interest but also my caution.</reflect>Ah, okay, so parang may long-term benefit ka once you start early? But still, parang wala pa talaga urgency for me eh.🙆

Agent: Yes, exactly! And tama ka, there’s no rush naman. Pero, isipin mo, having peace of mind knowing that you're covered, even if you're healthy—it’s really a good backup plan. Don’t you agree?

Maria: <reflect>He just mentioned peace of mind, I should acknowledge that point.</reflect>Oh, peace of mind, that’s true din. Pero like, right now, we feel pretty secure pa naman, kaya parang hindi pa kailangan talaga agad.🤔

Agent: Fair point, Maria. Saka nga sabi nila, there's no better time than now to plan for the future. Sometimes, things can happen unexpectedly and we'd want to be prepared, di ba?

Maria: <reflect>He mentioned being prepared; I can share my thought on that.</reflect>Oh yes! Talaga namang unpredictable ang life. But you know how it is, we tend to focus on what's immediate muna. 🙅

Agent: Absolutely, we all prioritize differently depending on our situations. Maybe I can share how other clients like you found it beneficial kahit they thought it wasn’t urgent?

Maria: <reflect>He's offering me an example; I should listen and then share my take.</reflect>Sige, I’m curious naman to hear! Though I still feel na it’s something for the future pa.🙆

Agent: Sure! Mga clients I've worked with initially had the same thoughts na hindi urgent. But when they experienced something unexpected, they felt so relieved na they had the insurance in place. It was a huge help sa kanila.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds comforting; I can acknowledge that but still stress my current stance.</reflect>Oh, that does sound comforting naman. Pero yun nga, as of now, parang we’re really focusing on other financial priorities pa eh.🙆

Agent: Got it, Maria. It’s good to focus on what you think is most immediate. But just so you know din, starting with small coverage could ease your way into comprehensive protection without too much financial pressure.

Maria: <reflect>He's suggesting starting small; I should consider that but still be cautious.</reflect>Ay, starting small sounds like an idea. Maybe I can consider that, but still, I'll talk to my family muna to see if we want to start na nga.🙅

Agent: Absolutely, discussing it with them is the best approach. And if ever kailangan niyo ng additional info or may questions sila, I’m just one call away to help clarify things.

Maria: <reflect>That's reassuring. I should let him know I'll keep that in mind.</reflect>Salamat ha, Alex. We'll definitely consider everything you mentioned. I'll think it over talaga after discussing with them.🙏

Agent: Perfect, Maria. Those are the best steps to take. It's all about making an informed choice that you and your family feel comfortable with. By the way, have you attended seminars about personal finance before? It might help for more insights din.

Maria: <reflect>That's a useful suggestion; I should mention if I've attended any.</reflect>Actually, yes, I have attended a few. Pero talagang busy pa so haven’t updated myself.🙆

Agent: That’s great to hear! Pero with everything you’ve learned, I’m sure you’re already making smart financial decisions. If you ever want more readings or materials, just let me know.

Maria: <reflect>That's thoughtful; I should acknowledge his offer.</reflect>Thank you, Alex. I'll keep that in mind. I appreciate all the info you’ve shared today!🙆 

Agent: Anytime, Maria. Thanks din for hearing me out. If you need a break from all the serious talk, maybe we can switch gears a bit? Got any fun weekend plans coming up?
