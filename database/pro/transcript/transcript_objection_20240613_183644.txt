 Agent: I'm glad we could discuss all the details, Maria. So, what do you think about our insurance policies so far?

Maria: <reflect>I'm still not that convinced about needing insurance; there might be better ways to use my money.</reflect>To be honest, I still have some hesitations. I mean, I don't really believe in insurance. Parang it's an unnecessary expense.✋

Agent: I understand your concern, Maria. But, have you ever considered how insurance can act as a safety net, protecting you and your loved ones from unexpected financial setbacks?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to address my doubts; I'll express my thoughts on why I think I don't need insurance.</reflect>Well, I see your point, but I'd rather invest the money. Mas madali ko pa makita ang returns, di ba? 🤔

Agent: Investing is indeed a good idea, but insurance actually complements an investment strategy. It's there to secure your investments in case of unforeseen circumstances. Investing in yourself and your future parang hitting two birds in one stone.

Maria: <reflect>I want to bring up another reason for my hesitation; I have my own emergency fund already.</reflect>Hmmm... I get it, pero I already have my own emergency fund. So I don't see the need for additional coverage. 🙌

Agent: Having an emergency fund is great, Maria! But emergency fund can only last so long, especially when facing major financial challenges like hospitalization. Our policies can provide that extra layer of protection beyond your savings.

Maria: <reflect>He always has a counter-argument; I should bring up the cost then.</reflect>Okay, but I still don't want to overpay for coverage I don't need. It’s like throwing money away.🤔

Agent: I hear you, Maria. Our policies are very flexible and can be tailored to suit your budget and specific needs. We have different plans, so you won't feel like you're overpaying. Plus, the peace of mind it gives is priceless.

Maria: <reflect>He’s not giving up, I should mention I’m healthy as another reason.</reflect>I don't think it's really necessary for me kasi I'm healthy naman. I don’t see the point in paying for something I'm unlikely to use. 💬

Agent: It's great that you’re in good health, Maria. That’s actually the best time to get insurance because it's more affordable and ensures you're covered before anything unexpected happens. Think of it as a wise precaution.

Maria: <reflect>I feel like I’ve heard it all before, I should ask more about the benefits to see if there’s anything compelling.</reflect>Alright, let's say I consider it. What exactly are the top benefits you can offer talaga? 🙏

Agent: Sure, Maria! Aside from the financial protection for your loved ones, our policies offer comprehensive healthcare coverage, accidental benefits, and even a savings component that grows over time. It’s like hitting multiple birds with one stone.

Maria: <reflect>He's listing quite a few benefits; I wonder if any of them might actually be useful for me.</reflect>Hmm, the healthcare coverage and savings part sounds kinda good, pero... I'm still not sure if it's enough to convince me. 🙆

Agent: Understandable, Maria. Maybe it would help to think about specific situations where having insurance could make a significant difference, like critical illness or a sudden accident. It’s the unforeseen events that make insurance a blessing.

Maria: <reflect>I should share that I'm not sure about long-term commitment either.</reflect>You know, another thing is I'm not great with long-term commitments. What if I change my mind later on? Is there a way out? 😕 

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Our policies come with flexible terms. There's always room to adjust your coverage or even switch to a different plan if your needs change. It's all about giving you control and peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds somewhat reassuring; I still want to know more about flexibility before committing.</reflect>That does sound more flexible than I thought. What if my financial situation changes and I can't keep up with the payments? 💬

Agent: Great question, Maria. We understand that financial situations can change. We have payment holiday options where you can pause payments without losing your coverage. It gives you the breathing room needed during tough times.

Maria: <reflect>He has an answer for everything. I'll let him know I'm thinking, but need more time.</reflect>Thanks for explaining all of that. I must admit, it's a lot to consider. I'll need some time to think this over. 🙆

Agent: Of course, Maria. Take your time. If you have any more questions or need further clarifications, don’t hesitate to reach out.
