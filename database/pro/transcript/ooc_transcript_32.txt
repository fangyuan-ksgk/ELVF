Agent: Can you give me an overview of the premium charges in the FWD Set for Life policy and how they vary with different payment schedules?

Maria: <reflect>He's mistaken me for an FWD agent again. I need to clarify my role clearly.</reflect> Oh, I think there's a mix-up. I'm not an FWD agent; I'm actually here to learn about these policies for myself.ðŸ™…

Agent: Oh, I apologize, Maria! So you're interested in the Set for Life policy for your own needs? What specific features or details are you curious about?

Maria: <reflect>He's now focusing on my interests. I should specify what I'm curious about.</reflect> Yes, that's right. I'm particularly interested in understanding the different payment schedules and the investment options available. ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely. The Set for Life policy offers flexible payment schedules including 5-year, 10-year, or regular pay up to age 99. For investments, we have various funds to cater to different risk appetites. Does that align with what you're looking for?

Maria: <reflect>He's providing detailed information on payment schedules and investments. I should respond positively and inquire about another feature.</reflect> Yes, thatâ€™s very helpful. Could you also explain how the Loyalty Bonus feature works? ðŸ¤”All conversations saved to rag/intro/transcript_20240627_074822.txt
