 Agent: So Maria, we've gone through all the essential details of our life insurance products, and I hope I've covered everything you're curious about. How are you feeling about it so far?

Maria: <reflect>I need to address that it's not urgent for me right now.</reflect> I've got to admit, it's very interesting. But, I'm still young, and to be honest, I'm not in a rush to get insurance. Like, I don't feel it's too urgent for me at the moment, considering my health and all that. 🙆

Agent: I totally understand that, Maria. It’s great to hear you’re in such good health! That's the best time to get insurance actually, when you're still healthy and young. You get better rates and more options. Have you ever thought about how you'd like things set for the future?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to point out the advantage of starting early.</reflect>Well, parang it's not a priority for me right now. I also need to discuss it with my family kasi they might have some thoughts on it. 🧐

Agent: Of course, including your family in the decision is important. But starting early also means you’re setting them up for greater peace of mind down the line. Have you considered what you want to achieve financially in the next few years?

Maria: <reflect>He’s bringing my family into the conversation. I'll mention it's not a priority.</reflect>Honestly, I haven't thought that far ahead yet. Parang saving money is more important for me at the moment. 🙅

Agent: Totally relatable, Maria! Saving money is very important. Life insurance can actually help with that because it's also a form of savings. Have you ever considered how having insurance can protect those savings from unexpected events or emergencies?

Maria: <reflect>He's tying insurance to savings, should acknowledge that.</reflect>Yeah, medyo naiintindihan ko. But right now, it’s not just a top priority. Need to focus on other things first, like maybe traveling while I'm still young. 👍

Agent: Traveling is a wonderful goal, Maria! With insurance, you can travel more peacefully, knowing that you and your loved ones are protected from unforeseen events. Have you thought about what might happen if there’s an unexpected expense while you’re traveling?

Maria: <reflect>He is suggesting it can protect me even while traveling.</reflect>Well, I suppose that’s something to consider. But for now, kasi, I really feel like it's something I can look into later. 🤔

Agent: True, timing is important. However, considering insurance doesn’t prevent you from enjoying life now – it actually complements it. Knowing that you’ve got a safety net allows you to fully embrace your travels and life experiences without worries. What do you think? Would you like your travels to be worry-free? 🙏

Maria: <reflect>He is making a good point about peace of mind. Acknowledge and redirect.</reflect>That's a nice thought, actually. Pero, I think I’ll feel more settled making a decision after I've discussed it with my family. 🙅

Agent: Discussions with family are definitely valuable. Just remember, the benefit of securing it now while you’re young and rates are more favorable can be a significant advantage down the line. Have you shared any of these thoughts with your family yet, or is it something fresh you’re considering? 

Maria: <reflect>Acknowledge his point on discussing with family.</reflect>Hmm, this is something bagong consideration lang. They'll probably think the same as me, that it's not urgent pa. 🙆

Agent: That's understandable, and often families do need to see the benefits clearly. Do you think they might have questions or concerns that we could address together to help everyone understand the advantages more completely?

Maria: <reflect>He’s inviting to address family concerns together.</reflect>Maybe, but I’d need to hear their thoughts first. I mean, they’re not in a hurry like me too. 😏

Agent: Fair point. What if we do this: Take the information we’ve discussed today, mull it over with your family, and jot down any possible questions they might have. I’ll be here to help address any concerns when you're ready. How does that sound?

Maria: <reflect>He’s giving me some time and space to think about it.</reflect>Sige, that sounds fair enough. I’ll definitely discuss it with them and see what they think.💬

Agent: That sounds great, Maria. Honestly, it's all about making a well-informed decision that you and your family are comfortable with. In the meantime, if there's anything else you think of or any more details you need, just drop me a message.

Maria: <reflect>Acknowledge his support and move the conversation forward.</reflect>I appreciate that, Alex. Actually, while we're at it, how customizable are these insurance plans? Can they be adjusted later on if my needs change? 🙏

Agent: Great question, Maria! Our plans are quite flexible and can be adjusted as per your evolving needs. We can always sit down and review your situation to ensure you’ve got the right coverage. Flexibility is key, right?

Maria: <reflect> He’s emphasizing flexibility, which is reassuring.</reflect>Oh, that’s good to know. It’s nice to have options in case my situation changes. 🙆
