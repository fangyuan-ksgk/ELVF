 Agent: So, Maria, we've gone through the product details of the policy I shared with you. Kamusta, finally nice to meet you and thanks for your time today. What do you think so far?

Maria: <reflect>Time to bring up my concerns about the trustworthiness of FWD.</reflect>Alex, I appreciate all the information, but to be honest, I've never heard of FWD before. Is it a new company?🤔

Agent: That's a valid concern, Maria. FWD is actually part of the Pacific Century Group, which has been around for a while. We may be relatively new in the Philippines compared to other insurance companies, but we pride ourselves on being innovative and customer-focused. We entered the market here to offer something fresh and different.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, he explained that well, but I still have more concerns.</reflect>Thanks for explaining, Alex. But I'm also worried that premiums might increase without clear reasons. I've heard stories about that happening.🙅

Agent: I get where you're coming from, Maria. At FWD, we ensure transparency with our policyholders. Any change in premiums will be communicated clearly, and you'll always know why. We aim to keep our rates stable and competitive.

Maria: <reflect>He handled that concern. Now, about adjusting the policy...</reflect>What if I need to adjust my policy later? I've heard some companies don't allow it and can be very strict.🤔

Agent: Great question, Maria. Flexibility is one of the key features of our policies at FWD. We understand circumstances can change, and we offer options for adjustments to meet your evolving needs. It's all about making the policy work for you.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds reassuring, but I'd rather buy from someone I know.</reflect>Well, I still feel more comfortable buying insurance from someone I know. You know what I mean? Like, you get a sense of trust when you know the person.🙅

Agent: I completely understand, Maria. Trust is very important in any financial decision. Our advisors at FWD are always available to build that relationship and trust with our clients. It's not just about selling a policy; it's about supporting you throughout your life.

Maria: <reflect>He's really trying to make a point about building trust. Maybe I should give him a chance.</reflect>Okay, I see what you're saying. But, why should I choose FWD over other insurance companies? What's your edge?🤔

Agent: Good question, Maria! At FWD, our policies are crafted to be straightforward, with no hidden terms or complicated jargon. We're also very committed to digital innovation, making managing your policy online a breeze. Plus, our claim process is fast and hassle-free.

Maria: <reflect>That's interesting. But still, what if I find better insurance elsewhere?</reflect>What if, after all this, I can find better insurance elsewhere?🙅

Agent: I understand the need to compare, Maria. In fact, I encourage it. We are confident in the value we offer, and it's important you find the right fit for your needs. Our goal is to ensure you have the best coverage and service, whether that's with us or another company. 

Maria: <reflect>Okay, he's quite confident in their offering. That shows reliability.</reflect>Okay, I get that. And you're sure there won't be any surprises down the line?🙏

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Transparency and reliability are what we stand by. We want to make sure you are always well-informed and satisfied with your policy.

Maria: <reflect>Sounds reassuring but I need to ask about affordability.'</reflect>How about affordability? I mean, is this something that won't break the bank?👍

Agent: Our policies are designed to fit various budgets, Maria. We offer customizable plans so you can choose the coverage that suits your financial situation without compromising on protection.

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing all my concerns. Maybe it's worth considering seriously now.</reflect>Thanks for explaining that, Alex. It's been really informative. How long has FWD been operating in the Philippines, by the way?🙆

Agent: We've been operating in the Philippines since 2014, and in that time, we have built a solid reputation for reliability and customer satisfaction. We're part of a larger network that's been successful in other Asian markets as well.

Maria: <reflect>2014 isn't very recent, so that's somewhat reassuring. Maybe this isn't such a bad idea.</reflect>Okay, that sounds quite established enough. Hmm, maybe it is worth considering after all. What other benefits can I expect?🤔
