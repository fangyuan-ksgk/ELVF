Agent: So Maria, I've introduced myself and did a bit of traffic talk. Now, I think you're curious about what makes FWD stand out from other insurance companies?

Maria: <reflect>This is my chance to dig deeper about FWD; I'll start by sharing my thoughts.</reflect>Ay sige, to be honest, I've only heard about FWD sa mga ads. Wala akong kilala na may FWD insurance. What makes it better than others? 🤔

Agent: That’s a valid question, Maria. Well, FWD is known for being innovative and customer-centric. We focus on making insurance simple and engaging. For example, have you heard of our Tapp app? It makes managing your policies super easy!

Maria: <reflect>Innovation sounds nice, but I need more than that.</reflect>Wow, that Tapp app sounds useful. Pero, what else do you offer? Like, are there any unique benefits or features?💬

Agent: Absolutely! One of our standout features is our hassle-free claims process. Unlike traditional insurance companies, we have a fast and easy claim submission through our app. Customers always appreciate getting their claims processed quickly, right?

Maria: <reflect>Quick claims process sounds promising but I need more convincing.</reflect>That's good to hear. Let's see, many claim that. How about customer service? Kasi, good customer service is super important to me. 🙏

Agent: We take customer service very seriously. Our customer support team is available 24/7. Plus, we have an in-app chat feature for instant assistance. Your peace of mind is our priority, Maria!

Maria: <reflect>24/7 support sounds reassuring, but I’m curious about the actual policies.</reflect>Okay, okay, that's great. But what about the actual policies? Like, are they customizable?🤔

Agent: Yes, our policies can be tailored to fit your needs. Whether you’re looking for life insurance, health coverage, or investment-linked plans, we can customize them to match your lifestyle and goals.

Maria: <reflect>Customization sounds flexible. But let’s see how much coverage I get. </reflect>Hmm, customizable sounds flexible. But how about coverage? How much coverage do you actually offer? 🙆

Agent: Our coverage options are extensive. Depending on the plan you choose, you can get coverage ranging from a few hundred thousand pesos to several million. We make sure your loved ones are fully protected.

Maria: <reflect>I need to see how this stands out from competition.</reflect>Okay, that's comprehensive. Pero ang dami ring ganyan sa market. Ano talaga ang edge nyo over others?👍

Agent: One of our edges is that we invest in advanced technology to make the customer experience smoother. For instance, we use AI for faster underwriting and claims processing, eliminating the traditional paperwork hassle.

Maria: <reflect>Advanced technology could be a good selling point for me.</reflect>Interesting. Pero, AI and technology, how does it actually help me as a customer? 🙆

Agent: Great question! With our tech, you get faster service, fewer errors, and more transparency. You can track everything in real-time and avoid the usual delays that come with manually processed paperwork.

Maria: <reflect>Transparency is important. But let's talk about rates now.</reflect>Transparency is talaga important. However, I also need to know about your rates. Are they competitive naman?🤔

Agent: Yes, our rates are very competitive. We offer value-for-money and no hidden charges. You get what you pay for, and often, more than that because of our added benefits and quality service.

Maria: <reflect>Good value is crucial. </reflect>That's reassuring then. Pero, since everyone claims good value, how do you measure it?💬

Agent: We measure value in terms of customer satisfaction and repeat clients. Many who start with a basic plan eventually upgrade to more comprehensive packages because they see the value we provide. Plus, our clients' positive feedback speaks volumes.

Maria: <reflect>Repeat clients could be a good indicator. </reflect>Okay, repeat clients and positive feedback sound like great indicators. Maybe I'll ask around if any friends are familiar with FWD. 🙆

Agent: That’s a good idea, Maria. And while you’re at it, you can also check out online reviews and testimonials. We’re confident you'll find that people are satisfied with our services. Anything else you’d like to know about our plans? 

Maria: <reflect>He's open to more questions, which is good.</reflect>Oo nga, I'll definitely do some research. For now, what kinds of flexible payment options do you offer? 🙏
