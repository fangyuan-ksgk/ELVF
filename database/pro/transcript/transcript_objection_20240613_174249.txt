 Agent: So, Maria, what do you think about our policy offerings so far?

Maria: <reflect>I liked the information, but it's better to address my budget concerns now.</reflect>Honestly, the policies sound great, but saving money is more important for me right now. And my budget is pretty tight na. 🙅

Agent: I understand, Maria. A lot of our clients feel the same way initially. But did you know we have flexible payment plans that can fit various budgets? Would that ease your concern a bit?

Maria: <reflect>I need to dive deeper into my financial situation so I can offer another concern...</reflect>Well, flexible payments are nice, pero I am still paying off my loan kase. It's hard to commit financially. 😢

Agent: I see where you're coming from. Paying off loans can be challenging. Would it help if we found a plan with a lower premium that we can gradually increase once you're more financially comfortable?

Maria: <reflect>This agent is really giving options, but I still need to be clear on priorities.</reflect>Totoo yan. But even with lower premiums, insurance isn't really a priority in my current budget. 🙅

Agent: Prioritizing is important, Maria. Have you considered how an insurance policy can act as a financial safety net, especially when unexpected expenses arise? It might actually save you in the long run.

Maria: <reflect>He has a point, but should keep my concerns valid.</reflect>Sige, but I've also heard that the premiums can get very expensive, especially if you need more coverage. 🙅

Agent: That's a valid concern. However, our policies can be customized. You can start small and then increase your coverage as your financial situation improves. It's really more about finding what works for you now and adjusting later.

Maria: <reflect>He’s got answers for everything… but how does this actually fit my situation?</reflect>I get it, but honestly speaking, my salary is not enough to spend on insurance right now. 💬

Agent: And that's a genuine concern. But even a small policy today can provide substantial benefits without making a huge dent in your salary. It’s about striking a balance.

Maria: <reflect>He’s making it sound so easy; let’s see if he can handle this next issue.</reflect>Okay but what if I lose my job? I won't want to be stuck with payments I can't handle. 🤔

Agent: Great point, Maria. We have policies with built-in flexibility for such instances. You can pause premiums for a specified period or make adjustments based on your situation. The idea is to ensure you’re always comfortable.

Maria: <reflect>He's quite persistent. Let's see how he tackles this last problem.</reflect>Hmm, interesting. But you know, no income means I really can't consider new expenses. I don't even feel secure right now. 😢

Agent: I understand how that feels. It's tough. Some of our policies include ways to help if your income stops unexpectedly. This financial safety net can ensure your basic needs are still covered.

Maria: <reflect>He has a good reply; maybe I should consider how this fits my long-term goals.</reflect>Real talk, that's quite helpful to know. It’s also a bit surprising to me. 🙌

Agent: It's always good to get a solid understanding. So, what are some of your long-term financial goals? Maybe we can tailor something to meet those specifically.

Maria: <reflect>He’s smart. I should take this chance to actually ask something useful for me.</reflect>Well, I want to focus on providing for my family and ensuring their future. How does insurance fit into that realistically?

Agent: That’s a very noble goal, Maria. Insurance can be a valuable tool. It ensures that no matter what happens, your family has financial support. It gives you peace of mind and financial security.

Maria: <reflect>I guess insurance isn’t that bad, especially considering my family's future.</reflect>I never thought it that way. Maybe you’re right, but still, it’s not easy to decide right away. 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, I completely understand. It’s a big decision. Take your time to think it over, and feel free to ask me any questions. However, looking into your future plans and any possible risks might make it clearer.
