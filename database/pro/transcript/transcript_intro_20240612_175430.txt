Agent: Mahal na may-ari ng makati traffic survival skill! While we're enjoying our drinks, I'd like to get to know you more. Pwede ko bang malaman ang financial and family goals mo? Alam mo na, para we know paano tayong mas makatulong sa 'yo.

Maria: <reflect>Naku, mukhang seryoso na ang usapan, pero game na para malaman ko ang plano nila.</reflect>Sure! For my financial goals, I'd love to save up for a house, maybe some travel funds din. As for family, wala pa akong sarili, it's more supporting my parents pa rin.🤔

Agent: That's a good plan, Maria! Investing in a house and traveling sounds like great goals. Do you have any existing investments or savings na naka-set aside for these goals?

Maria: <reflect>He's diving into the details, I should be straightforward.</reflect>Actually, I do some monthly savings and may konting investments sa mutual funds. Pero very minimal lang. 🙏

Agent: That's a good start, Maria! Ang importante naman, may naipon kahit konti. How long have you been actively saving and investing?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to gauge my experience.</reflect>I've been saving seriously for about three years now. Nagsimula ako when I got my first full-time job as a graphic designer. 💬

Agent: Wow, that's impressive! Consistency is key talaga sa ganyan. Are you also preparing for any emergencies or unforeseen expenses?

Maria: <reflect>I should mention my emergency funds.</reflect>Oh yes, meron din akong emergency fund. Not much, but sapat na for a few months’ worth of expenses. 🙆

Agent: Very smart move, Maria! It's great to have that buffer. Now, have you ever thought about protecting those savings and investments with an insurance plan?

Maria: <reflect>He's slowly introducing the insurance product na, I should show some interest.</reflect>Actually, I've thought about it, pero I don't know much about the different options available. Paano ba yun?🙏

Agent: Good question! At FWD, we have various plans tailored for different needs. May mga life insurance, health insurance, at even investment-linked insurance plans that can help you meet your goals and protect your savings.

Maria: <reflect>Parang interesting to, I'll ask how these work.</reflect>Wow, so paano ba nagwo-work yung investment-linked plans? 🤔

Agent: Basically, investment-linked plans offer life protection while letting you invest a portion of your premiums sa various funds, so you get to grow your money over time while being covered.

Maria: <reflect>Siguro I should ask a specific scenario.</reflect>Okay, so if I choose an investment-linked plan, let's say may emergency abroad ako, will it cover my medical costs?🤔

Agent: Yes, most of our investment-linked plans come with global coverage for medical emergencies. It can provide you the peace of mind you need when traveling.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds promising, I should ask about flexibility.</reflect>Galing! What if I need to access my funds? Paano yung flexibility ng mga plans?🙆

Agent: Great question! Our plans offer flexibility so you can make partial withdrawals or even policy loans, depending on the fund performance and terms of the policy.

Maria: <reflect>Seems like it's very adaptable, I'll show appreciation and ask more on eligibility.</reflect>Astig naman! Meron bang eligibility requirements sa mga plans na ito? Like age limits or health conditions? 💬

Agent: Generally, we have plans that cater to different age groups and health conditions. Of course, there will be assessments and underwriting, pero we make sure to provide the best options available.

Maria: <reflect>Interesting, I want to know how quick can start with it.</reflect>Good to know. So let's say I decide to go for it, how quick can I start with the process?🙏

Agent: The process can be pretty quick. Once we assess your needs and you submit the necessary documents, you can get insured in a matter of days to weeks, depending on the plan.

Maria: <reflect>He's making it sound easy. Let's see how they assist clients post-purchase.</reflect>Nice! How about after-sales support? How does FWD assist clients after they purchase a plan? 🤔

Agent: We have a dedicated customer service team and financial advisors available for any questions or assistance you might need post-purchase. Plus, you can manage your policy online for convenience.

Maria: <reflect>Good to know they're supportive. Let's see if they offer customization.</reflect>That's reassuring. Can I customize my plan? Like, can I add riders or adjust coverage if needed? 🙆
