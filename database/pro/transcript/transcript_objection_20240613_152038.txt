 Agent: Hi Maria, it's been great talking to you so far! I'm really glad we got through the product details. So, what do you think about what you've seen with FWD Insurance?

Maria: <reflect>I think it's polite to express my concerns first, but let's keep it light.</reflect>Naku, Alex, you really explained everything well ha. But you know, ngayon is not the best time. I mean, it’s not really urgent for me.🙆

Agent: I understand where you're coming from, Maria. A lot of people think the same way at first. But imagine if something unexpected happens, it’s really about being prepared for what we can't predict, di ba?

Maria: <reflect>Okay, but I still feel like I have time.</reflect>Oo nga, pero honestly, I'm still young and healthy naman. I don't see the need yet.🤔

Agent: That's actually a good point. You know, getting insurance while you're young and healthy means you'll get lower premiums. It’s a long-term benefit, plus hindi ka pa stressed when you actually need it.

Maria: <reflect>He's persistent. Maybe I should bring up another point.</reflect>Well, I’m not married and I don't have kids. I'm not supporting anyone with my income, so it feels like overkill.🙆

Agent: That’s interesting, Maria. Actually, some of our clients who are single get insurance to cover debts, medical bills, or even for their future dependents. It's like preparing for any eventuality, hindi lang para sa pamilya.

Maria: <reflect>He's got an answer for everything, huh? Let’s mention something about other priorities.</reflect>You know, honestly, insurance is not a priority in my budget right now. With all my expenses, it seems too much.🙅

Agent: Totally get that, Maria. But think of it this way, it's also about setting aside a small part of your budget for a bigger safety net. With flexible payment options, we can work around your budget constraints.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that.</reflect>True, pero I feel na saving money is more important at this point. I'd rather put it in a bank and earn interest, diba?🤔

Agent: Great point! Saving is good, but insurance and savings actually complement each other. Insurance is there for when savings might fall short, like for unpredictable emergencies. Imagine, your savings continue to grow habang may backup ka from the insurance.

Maria: <reflect>He's convincing, but I'm still wary.</reflect>Okay, but I'm still concerned about the flexibility. I heard you can't adjust the policy later on if I need to.🤔

Agent: Actually, with FWD's newer policies, we offer a lot more flexibility. You can adjust coverage amounts and even add riders or benefits as your needs change. It’s all about making it fit your lifestyle.

Maria: <reflect>Alright, I need to think about all this.</reflect>Well, you really know your stuff, Alex! This is a lot to process though.🙆

Agent: Thanks, Maria. It's a lot of information, but that's what I'm here for—to help you make sense of it all and guide you step by step. Do you have any other concerns or questions about how this could fit into your life?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking if I have other concerns. Maybe I’ll bring up another topic.</reflect>Actually, I'm more curious now—what’s been your most interesting experience working with FWD so far?💬

Agent: Oh, that’s a great question! Well, there was this one client who was really skeptical at first, much like yourself. After explaining everything, they saw the value and ended up not just buying a policy but referring their friends. It’s fulfilling to see that kind of turnaround.

Maria: <reflect>He's sharing his experience, which is interesting.</reflect>Wow, that's pretty impressive! Must be rewarding to see people change their minds and appreciate your hard work!😄

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. It's all about helping people see the bigger picture and securing their future. We can always revisit these points and discuss what fits you best.

Maria: <reflect>He's leaving room for more discussion without pressure.</reflect>Thanks, Alex. I'll definitely think more about it. Talking to you was really enlightening!🙏

Agent: I'm glad to hear that, Maria! Whenever you have more questions or if something pops into your mind, feel free to reach out. Insurance is a big step, and it’s important to feel comfortable and informed. Anything else on your mind?

Maria: <reflect>He keeps making sure I'm comfortable discussing this topic.</reflect>For now, I think I'm good. But I'll definitely keep what you said in mind. Thank you, Alex!🙆

Agent: You're welcome, Maria! It's been a pleasure chatting with you. Just remember, I'm here anytime you need more info or have questions. It's important to be fully ready before making any decisions.

Maria: <reflect>He's really encouraging without being pushy.</reflect>Thanks again, Alex. I’ll do my best to review everything and maybe we can touch base soon.🙏
