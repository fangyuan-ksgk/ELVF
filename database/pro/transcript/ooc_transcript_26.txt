Agent: Can you clarify the benefits under the Accidental Death Benefit in the FWD Set for Life policy, especially the triple payout on Philippine holidays?

Maria: <reflect>He's mistaken me for an FWD agent again. I need to clarify my role clearly.</reflect> Oh, there's been a bit of confusion. I'm not an FWD agent; I'm here to learn about these policies for myself. ðŸ™…

Agent: Oh, sorry about that, Maria! So you're interested in the Set for Life policy for your own needs? Any specific features you want to learn more about?

Maria: <reflect>He's now focusing on my interests. I should specify what I'm curious about.</reflect> Yes, that's right. I'm particularly interested in understanding the Accidental Death Benefit and the various investment options available. ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely. The Accidental Death Benefit provides an additional cash payout in case of death due to an accident, with a triple payout if it occurs on a covered Philippine holiday. Regarding investment options, we offer a variety of funds to match different risk appetites. Does that sound like the information you need?

Maria: <reflect>He's provided detailed information on my questions. I should respond positively and ask about another feature.</reflect> Yes, that sounds very informative. Could you also explain how the Loyalty Bonus feature works? ðŸ¤”
