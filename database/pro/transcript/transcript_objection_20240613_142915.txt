 Agent: I'm so glad you like the product details we've shared, Maria. What do you think so far?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking for my thoughts; I should mention my hesitation about urgency.</reflect>You know, Alex, you've explained everything really well. But honestly, I feel like it's not something I need to rush into. I mean, I'm still young and healthy naman.🤔

Agent: I understand where you're coming from, Maria. Many people feel the same way at first. But think of it as preparing for a rainy day. An umbrella doesn't seem important until it starts pouring, di ba?

Maria: <reflect>He does have a point, but I'll stick to my hesitation for now.</reflect>That's true, but I guess it's just not my priority at the moment. I need to speak to my family about it first. 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, getting your family's input is important. But wouldn't it be great if they saw you taking a proactive step towards securing everyone's future? It's like being the MVP of the family!

Maria: <reflect>That's an interesting angle, but I'm still unsure.</reflect>Actually, I like the idea of being the MVP! But still, it's not really urgent for me. Now is just not a good time.🙆

Agent: I get it, timing is important. But remember, life has its way of surprising us. By choosing to wait, we might be caught off guard at a crucial moment. And having insurance means you’ve already got your back covered, hassle-free!

Maria: <reflect>He’s making a valid point, but I’m still not convinced.</reflect>You’re right, life is full of surprises. But I still think I’d rather focus on other priorities muna. Besides, like I said, I’m healthy and don’t see this as urgent. 🤔

Agent: That's a fair point, Maria. But insurance isn't just for when you're sick or injured. It also helps in case of unexpected events like accidents or even job loss. It’s more of a safety net than just health coverage.

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to show the broader benefits; I should acknowledge that.</reflect>Well, I didn't think of it that way. Maybe I need to do more research to fully understand its benefits, you know. 🙅

Agent: Definitely, take all the time you need. But why not start now? The sooner you get protected, the sooner you can have peace of mind. Plus, the earlier you start, the lower your premiums!

Maria: <reflect>He's suggesting I start now again, but I still feel hesitant.</reflect>Kaya nga, I want to make sure I'm getting the best deal. I might want to compare products from other companies first. 💬

Agent: That's totally valid. It makes sense to compare. But FWD offers some unique benefits that you won't find elsewhere, like the ability to adjust your policy as your needs change.

Maria: <reflect>I should consider this flexibility he's talking about.</reflect>Being able to adjust the policy later on sounds good... but again, I prefer to take my time. 

Agent: Of course, taking your time is important. But keep in mind, the younger you are when you start, the better the benefits you'll enjoy in the long run. It's like investing in your future self.

Maria: <reflect>He’s emphasizing long-term benefits; I’m still not sure though.</reflect>I see your point. But saving money is also a priority for me right now. 🤑

Agent: And I completely respect that, Maria. Think of insurance as a way to protect those savings. Instead of spending all your money on unexpected costs, insurance can cover major expenses, allowing you to keep your savings intact.

Maria: <reflect>He’s relating insurance to saving money; interesting angle.</reflect>That does sound practical... but I still have to consider my budget. I’ve heard the premiums can be quite expensive. 🤔

Agent: Great point. But at FWD, we offer flexible payment options that can fit different budgets. Plus, it's like setting aside a small amount now to avoid a big financial hit in the future. Isn’t that a smart move? 

Maria: <reflect>He’s stressing on flexibility and budget-friendly options.</reflect>I appreciate the flexibility and the thought behind it. Maybe I just need more time to think it over and discuss with my family. 💬

Agent: That's completely understandable, Maria. It’s a significant decision. But remember, every day you wait is another day without that safety net. It's like waiting to put on a seatbelt until after the accident happens. Why not be ahead and secure now?

Maria: <reflect>He's making good points about being proactive.</reflect>I get what you mean, and it makes sense. But still, I feel like I need to weigh things more carefully.

Agent: Of course, Maria. Take your time to weigh everything carefully. Just remember, we're here to support you every step of the way, whenever you decide the time is right for you.
