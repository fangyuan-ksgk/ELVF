 Agent: Letâ€™s get into the crux of our discussion. So, based on what weâ€™ve talked about so far, why do you think insurance might not be a good fit for you, Maria?

Maria: <reflect>I don't believe in insurance. I'd rather invest the money into something else.</reflect>Kasi naman, I don't really believe in insurance. I'd rather use the money to invest in something else, like maybe a business or something profitable. ðŸ™†

Agent: I understand where you're coming from, Maria. But think about this: while investments can grow your wealth, insurance is your safety net. It prevents you from having to dip into those investments in case of emergencies. What would happen if an unexpected expense popped up?

Maria: <reflect>He makes a point, but I'm still concerned about overpaying for coverage I don't need.</reflect>Sige, maybe you have a point there. Pero, I don't want to overpay for coverage that I don't need. Baka sayang lang yung pera if I end up not using it. ðŸ¤”

Agent: That's perfectly understandable. Our policies are highly customizable to ensure you only pay for what you really need. You can adjust the coverage according to your specific requirements and financial goals. Isn't that a better way to ensure you're covered?

Maria: <reflect>I already have assets, so I feel like I'm already secure in that aspect.</reflect>Well, I already have some assets naman. I feel like I'm already covered in terms of financial security. Why would I need insurance on top of that?

Agent: It's great that you have assets, Maria. However, assets can be lost or devalued. Insurance provides a guaranteed safeguard. Itâ€™s like a backup for your backup. In times of crisis, selling off assets might not be the best or quickest option. Doesn't an insurance policy make sense as an added layer of security?

Maria: <reflect>I'm still a bit skeptical, but heâ€™s making some valid points. Maybe it's worth listening to more details.</reflect>Hmm, youâ€™re making some valid points. Fine, let's discuss more details. But, I'm still very picky about this. ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m hereâ€”to help tailor something that meets all your needs perfectly. Letâ€™s go through what a basic plan would look like for you.

Maria: <reflect>Itâ€™s better to know the fine print dahil baka Iâ€™m missing something important.</reflect>Just be sure to explain everything ha? Ayoko naman ng surprises down the road. ðŸ™…

Agent: Of course, Maria. Transparency is key. I'll provide you with all the details including the exclusions and any hidden charges, so you'll know exactly what youâ€™re signing up for. Does that sound fair?

Maria: <reflect>Fine, this seems honest. Iâ€™ll give it a go but keep asking questions.</reflect>Ay, that sounds fair enough. Sige, go ahead. Explain it to me. ðŸ™‹

Agent: Great! Letâ€™s start with the basic coverage. This plan ensures that in case of hospitalization, all your medical expenses are covered. It also includes a lump sum payout for critical illnesses. How does that sound?

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s giving specifics now. I should ask about the costs in detail.</reflect>Sige, but how much is that going to cost me exactly? I want to make sure it's within my budget. ðŸ¤”

Agent: We offer a range of plans starting from a few thousand pesos a month. It really depends on the level of coverage you opt for. I can help you find something that fits comfortably within your monthly expenses. Can we work on that together?

Maria: <reflect>It sounds reasonable but I should know about any commitments or lock-ins.</reflect>Sounds reasonable, pero are there any commitments or lock-in periods I should know about?

Agent: Great question, Maria. Typically, most policies have an initial lock-in period of 2 to 3 years, but it really varies. After that, you have the flexibility to adjust or even cancel the plan if it no longer suits your needs. How does that sound for you?

Maria: <reflect>That seems okay. Maybe I should ask about the additional benefits to make sure I get the most out of it.</reflect>Okay naman siya, but what about the additional benefits? May perks ba for me if I stick to this plan long-term?

Agent: Absolutely! If you maintain the policy long-term, you can avail of benefits like no-claim bonuses, which reduce your premium over time, and a possible return on premium under certain conditions. Plus, you'll have peace of mind knowing you're protected. Isnâ€™t that reassuring?

Maria: <reflect>Those benefits sound good. Iâ€™m feeling a bit more convinced now.</reflect>Uy, that sounds really good ha! Maybe I will think more seriously about this policy. ðŸ™‹

Agent: Iâ€™m glad to hear that, Maria. Taking control of your future is definitely worth considering. Any more questions or concerns? Let's address everything so you're fully confident in your decision.

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s thorough, I should ask about the payout process in case something happens.</reflect>Hmm, how about the payout process? Minsan kasi, itâ€™s so complicated dealing with insurance companies. How quick and easy is it?

Agent: Excellent query, Maria. FWD ensures a hassle-free claims process. We provide a straightforward claims form, and our dedicated claims team works efficiently to process and settle claims as quickly as possible, often within 15 working days. Is that something that gives you confidence?
