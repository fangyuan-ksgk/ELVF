 Agent: So, Maria, we've discussed the product benefits and how it can be tailored to your needs. What do you think so far?

Maria: <reflect>I should tell him about my financial situation. Maybe he'll understand.</reflect> You know, Alex, the product sounds great but, honestly, I'm a bit tight right now. My salary is not enough to spend on insurance. üôÖ

Agent: I understand, Maria. Many of our clients felt the same at first. However, consider this: having insurance can actually save you money in the long run by covering unexpected expenses. What if I told you we can find a plan that fits within your budget?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to make it sound affordable. I'll mention my other financial commitments.</reflect> That sounds nice, pero I'm still paying off my loan. Adding another expense might be too much for me right now. ü§î

Agent: That's quite common and very understandable. One of the advantages of our plans is the flexibility to adjust payments depending on your financial situation. Maybe we can find a middle ground that doesn't strain your current budget?

Maria: <reflect>He seems eager to accommodate my situation. I'll mention my main concern about money again.</reflect> Kaya lang, I feel like it might be better to save the money in the bank to earn interest, di ba? ü§î

Agent: Definitely, savings accounts are important. But remember, they don't provide the same coverage and peace of mind that insurance does. A balanced financial strategy includes both savings and protection. What if we start with a minimal plan that grows as your financial flexibility improves?

Maria: <reflect>He's making some good points but I still have my doubts.</reflect> Hmmm, I see your point. But how sure am I that I won't overpay for the coverage I don't need?

Agent: Good question, Maria. We offer tailored policies designed based on individual needs. We'll work together to ensure you're only paying for what you truly need and can afford. Think of it like getting a bespoke suit rather than something off the rack.

Maria: <reflect>That makes some sense. But I‚Äôve been managing okay so far without insurance.</reflect> I understand your point, pero I think I am saving enough on my own. Can't I just continue that way?

Agent: You‚Äôre doing a great job by saving. But, unforeseen events can sometimes wipe out savings very quickly. Insurance acts as a safety net to protect those savings. Why let your hard-earned money be at risk when a small investment in insurance can provide that security?

Maria: <reflect>That's true. Maybe he's right about risks. I'll inquire more.</reflect> You do have a point there. Pero, what if I get sick or something, already? Does that affect my eligibility?

Agent: That‚Äôs a valid concern. At FWD, we have policies that can accommodate health histories. It's best to get a comprehensive check so we can find the right fit for you. We're here to make sure you're protected, no matter your situation.

Maria: <reflect>He's very persistent but in a considerate way. Maybe I should ask about specifics.</reflect> That's reassuring. Can you share more about these adjustable payment options? üôÜ

Agent: Absolutely. For instance, we offer options where you can lower your premium in challenging times and then increase it once you're more financially comfortable. This way, you won‚Äôt be overwhelmed by the cost, yet you'll still have some level of protection.

Maria: <reflect>Flexible payments sound good. I need to be sure this is a wise investment. I should know more about the claims process.</reflect> That sounds flexible. Pero, how about the claims process? Is it straightforward? üôè

Agent: Yes, our claims process is designed to be hassle-free. We know that during difficult times, the last thing you need is more stress. So, we've streamlined our process to make it as smooth as possible. Plus, you always have a representative to assist you.

Maria: <reflect>Seems like they‚Äôve thought of everything. Perhaps I should clarify one more point about the benefits.</reflect> That sounds convenient. And what specific benefits can I expect from the policy that would directly help in my situation? üôÜ

Agent: Well, our policies include a variety of benefits such as critical illness coverage, income protection, and even education funds for your kids. We match these benefits to your personal and financial situation, ensuring you get the most relevant coverage.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds helpful, especially the education fund. I didn't think about that. I should confirm how customizable it is.</reflect> That sounds useful, particularly the education fund. Puwede ba talaga siyang i-customize to what I specifically need? ü§î

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Customization is one of our key strengths. We'll sit down and detail exactly what your priorities are so you won‚Äôt be paying for anything unnecessary. You can always adjust the coverage as your situation changes.

Maria: <reflect>He's offering quite a few options that seem to address my concerns. I'm still not fully convinced but I'll give him that he's thorough.</reflect> Thank you for explaining all that. I have to say, you've given me a lot of useful information today. üôè

Agent: I'm glad to hear that, Maria. We're here to support you and make this an easy decision. Is there anything else you're curious about regarding our insurance plans?
