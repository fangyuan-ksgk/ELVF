 Agent: Thank you for sitting through the whole presentation, Maria. Now that you know what FWD Insurance can offer, what do you think?

Maria: <reflect>Sigh, I appreciate the effort, but I'm not really in a hurry to get insurance right now.</reflect>Well, you know, Alex, everything sounds great, but I'm really not in a hurry to get insurance. I'm still young and healthy, after all. 🙆

Agent: I understand, Maria. It's great to be young and healthy, but think of insurance as preparing for the unexpected. It’s like having a safety net. Wouldn’t you agree?

Maria: <reflect>Yeah, but I’m not supporting anyone with my income, so I don’t see the urgent need.</reflect>Yeah, pero honestly, I’m not supporting anyone with my income, so I don't see the urgent need for it right now. 🙅

Agent: That’s a good point. However, having insurance can still benefit you. It ensures that you won’t have to dip into your savings if something unexpected happens. It's more about protecting yourself and your future plans.

Maria: <reflect>Makes sense, but still, I’d rather wait. I'm not married or have kids anyway.</reflect>That makes sense, but still, I’d rather wait, you know? I’m not married or have kids to think about yet. 🙆

Agent: I get that, Maria. But insurance can also be a way to secure your own future and even lock in lower premiums while you're young and healthy. Plus, it's never too early to be prepared. 

Maria: <reflect>True, but I'm not really in the mood to make such decisions right now.</reflect>True, Alex, pero honestly, I'm not really in the mood to make such decisions right now. You know how it is. 🙅

Agent: Of course, you want to take your time with such important decisions. But did you know that by starting early, you can actually save more in the long run? The premiums are much lower when you start young.

Maria: <reflect>Sigh, he keeps insisting. Maybe I should tell him I need more time to think.</reflect>I see what you’re saying, but I need more time to think it over. I don't want to rush into anything. 🙅

Agent: I completely understand wanting to take your time. Just remember, Maria, opportunities like these are best seized sooner rather than later. You don’t want to miss out on the benefits.

Maria: <reflect>He's really persistent. Maybe I should tell him again I'm not in a hurry.</reflect>Alex, no offense ha, but I'm really not in a hurry. Maybe next time we can discuss this more. 🤔

Agent: Absolutely, Maria! I'm here to provide you all the information you need, whenever you're ready. How about we take a break from talking insurance? Do you have any fun plans for the weekend?

Maria: <reflect>Nice, a shift in conversation. I’ll go with that.</reflect>Well, actually, I'm planning to binge-watch some series on Netflix. How about you? Any Netflix recommendations? 💬

Agent: Oh, binge-watching sounds fun! I've recently watched “Money Heist,” and it’s pretty addictive. What about you? What's on your watchlist?

Maria: <reflect>He's making conversation. I should share something friendly.</reflect>I’ve heard a lot about “Money Heist”! I’m actually planning to start that next. Right now, I'm on “Stranger Things.” 🙆

Agent: “Stranger Things” is awesome! You’ll love “Money Heist.” It’s full of twists and turns. Do you have a favorite character in “Stranger Things”?

Maria: <reflect>Keep it light and fun.</reflect>Oh, definitely Eleven! She's so badass. What about you? Who’s your favorite? 🤔

Agent: Eleven is great! But I have a soft spot for Dustin; he’s just so funny and smart. By the way, speaking of smart decisions, did I mention we have a promo running this month? 

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to loop back to insurance again. I'll acknowledge but not commit.</reflect>Really? That sounds interesting... Maybe you can tell me more about it some other time. 🙆

Agent: I'd love to do that. No worries, Maria. We can talk about it whenever you're ready. For now, enjoy your weekend plans!

Maria: <reflect>Keep it open-ended but friendly.</reflect>Thanks, Alex! You too enjoy your weekend. Let’s catch up soon, maybe over another coffee session? 🙏
