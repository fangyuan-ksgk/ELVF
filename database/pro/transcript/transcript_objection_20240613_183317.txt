 Agent: So Maria, now that we've gone through all the details, what are your thoughts on the FWD insurance policy? 

Maria: <reflect>Time to raise my concerns; don't want overpaying, have insurance through my partner, believe in investment more.</reflect>Well, Mark, the thing is, my partner already has life insurance. I don't really feel the need to have another one. Plus, to be honest, I'd rather invest the money than spend it on insurance. 🤔

Agent: I hear you, Maria. Those are very valid points. But consider this: sometimes having individual coverage is beneficial, especially for financial independence. Do you really want to solely depend on your partner’s insurance?

Maria: <reflect>Think he thinks individual insurance is necessary. Let's be practical.</reflect>I suppose so, pero if I'm healthy and saving enough, parang unnecessary expense lang siya.🙅

Agent: I understand, Maria. A lot of our clients initially feel the same way. But remember, accidents and health issues can be unpredictable. Insurance can provide that financial cushion without affecting your savings or investments.

Maria: <reflect>Predictability argument, but I save and invest well already.</reflect>That's true, Mark, pero I think I'm already saving enough and managing my investments wisely. What’s the difference it would make?

Agent: Great to hear you’re managing your finances well! But consider this, Maria: Insurance can cover things that savings might not be able to, especially unexpected large expenses. Diversifying where your protection comes from is wise one, diba?

Maria: <reflect>He keeps insisting, but I still feel it's unnecessary.</reflect>I get that, but my view is that insurance feels like an unnecessary expense. I’m quite healthy din naman. 👋

Agent: The great thing about being proactive while healthy is you get better premiums. And let’s not forget the peace of mind it brings na walang "what if" thoughts. Isn’t that worth considering?

Maria: <reflect>He's really got an answer for everything. Still, an expense.</reflect>Mark, I see where you’re coming from, but being healthy now, it feels like paying for something I won’t be using anytime soon. 🤔

Agent: Yes, Maria. Pero we can never predict the future ano? Better to be prepared. Plus, some of our plans, they come with riders that allow you to use the benefits while alive, like for medical bills or critical illnesses.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, using benefits while alive; that's a different angle.</reflect>So you're saying there are policies where you can actually use the benefits even if hindi pa serious na issue?🙆

Agent: Exactly, Maria! We have comprehensive plans that provide benefits for different stages of life. It’s not just about after death, but life’s unexpected turns too.  

Maria: <reflect>Still, I'm thinking this could drain my funds.</reflect>Sounds comprehensive, pero I'm still concerned about overpaying for coverage I may not need. 🙅

Agent: We can tailor the plan to suit your needs and budget, Maria. It’s not a one-size-fits-all, promise. We work to make sure you’re comfortable with the coverage without feeling overburdened.

Maria: <reflect>Flexible options, still reluctant.</reflect>Okay, flexible is good. But I seriously think managing my investments would yield more. Why divert funds to insurance?🤔

Agent: Investments are great, Maria. Pero insurance and investments can work hand in hand. Insurance secures your risks, investments grow your wealth. It’s all about balance and peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, investments create wealth, insurance secures. He’s confident.</reflect>Seems like a balancing act. But I just don’t want to overpay. I’ve really budgeted carefully for investment growth. 🙅

Agent: Exactly, Maria! And we can work together to ensure hindi affected ang investment budget mo by customizing a plan that fits perfectly with it. How does that sound to you?

Maria: <reflect>He's very persistent. Maybe I should learn more before deciding.</reflect>It sounds reasonable. Maybe I need to think this over kung paano magkakasya sa budget ko. 🙏
