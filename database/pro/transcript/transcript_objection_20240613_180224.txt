 Agent: So Maria, now that we've gone through the details of the policy, what do you think so far?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking for my opinion; I should start with my concerns</reflect>Well, the policy sounds comprehensive and all, but honestly, my salary isn't enough to spend on insurance at the moment. Pa'no yan? 🤔

Agent: It's perfectly understandable, Maria. A lot of our clients initially feel the same way, but we have flexible payment options that might fit your budget. How do you currently manage your finances on essentials and savings?

Maria: <reflect>He wants to know about my budgeting; I should respond with honesty.</reflect>To be honest, I'm still paying off my loan, kaya medyo tight talaga ang budget ko ngayon. 🙅

Agent: Loans can be really challenging, especially with daily expenses. One of the benefits of having this insurance policy is that it can act as a safety net. What if we design a plan that balances your loan payments and insurance premiums? Would that make a difference?

Maria: <reflect>He’s suggesting an option to balance both; I should think about it.</reflect>I guess that could work, but another thing is, I really think it’s better to save my money in the bank to earn interest, di ba? 🙆

Agent: That’s a valid point, Maria. Bank savings do earn interest, but the rates are quite low. Plus, savings can't cover unexpected large expenses like medical emergencies or sudden loss of income. A policy like this complements your savings without putting too much strain on your budget. Have you considered how insurance can indirectly protect your savings?

Maria: <reflect>His point is to secure my savings with insurance; it's logical.</reflect>Hmm, actually, I didn’t think of it that way. You’re saying, it’s like a safety net for my savings? 🤔

Agent: Exactly! It ensures you won’t have to dip into your savings for major unplanned expenses. It’s more like protecting your hard-earned money in the bank. Speaking of protection, have you discussed this with your partner? How do they feel about having additional financial security?

Maria: <reflect>He’s changing the topic a bit, but I should acknowledge it.</reflect>Yes, my partner already has life insurance, so parang doble na, di ba? 🙏

Agent: I get that, but consider this: having individual policies means you both are independently covered. If something happens to one of you, the other won’t have to worry about losing coverage. Sometimes, it’s not only about who has insurance but how well both of you are protected. What do you think your partner would say?

Maria: <reflect>He’s making a valid point about individual coverage; I should consider it.</reflect>I’ll admit, that makes sense. Maybe I can discuss it with them. But do you think I’m overthinking this? Like, I don’t want to overpay for coverage I don’t need, eh. 🙅

Agent: It’s good to be cautious. Overpaying is a common concern, but our policies are tailored to match your specific needs and avoid unnecessary costs. We can adjust the coverage based on what's most important to you right now. How does that sound?

Maria: <reflect>He’s offering to customize the policy; it sounds reasonable.</reflect>Okay, if it can be tailored like that, it does sound more feasible. But I’m just worried about adding another expense to my monthly bills. 🤔

Agent: Understandable, Maria. We ensure our policies are designed to provide maximum benefits without overwhelming your budget. Plus, the long-term advantages often outweigh the costs. Did you know that this policy also offers potential growth on cash value?

Maria: <reflect>He's talking about the growth potential now; that could be good.</reflect>No, I wasn’t aware! So may growth potential din siya? 🙆

Agent: Yes, indeed! It’s like getting the best of both worlds—protection and growth. The policy can accumulate value over time, which you can use in the future. This means you’re not just securing your present but also investing in your future. How does this align with your financial goals?

Maria: <reflect>Future growth sounds like a good deal; I should express my interest.</reflect>That actually sounds promising. If it can grow over time, that makes it more like an investment, right? 💬

Agent: Exactly, Maria! It’s like hitting two birds with one stone—making sure you’re protected now while also planning for the future. Speaking of planning, what are your main financial goals for the coming years?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking about my goals now; I should share my plans.</reflect>Well, I really want to save up for a house and maybe start a small business. Those are my top priorities at the moment. 🙆
