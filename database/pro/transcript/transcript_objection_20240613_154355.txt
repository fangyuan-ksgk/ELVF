 Agent: Thanks for sharing your story earlier, Maria. Now that we've covered all the details, do you have any concerns or questions about the policy?

Maria: <reflect>Ok, he's asking about my concerns. Let's see, I have a few in mind.</reflect>Actually, meron. First of all, I want to compare products from other companies. Like, I prefer to be sure I'm getting the best deal, you know?

Agent: I totally get that, Maria. It's really smart to compare. But did you know that FWD offers some unique features like our waiver of premium rider, which can really save you money in the long run?

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing my concern about comparing but I still want more assurance. I should bring up another point.</reflect>Okay, but I also heard about premium increases without clear reason. Kahit pa best deal at first, if the premiums increase, parang you end up paying more eventually.

Agent: That's a valid point, Maria. At FWD, we strive to be transparent about our premium adjustments. Any changes would be communicated well in advance, and there's always a clear reasoning behind them.

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to be reassuring. Letâ€™s see, I have one more concern to address.</reflect>Right, pero what if I want to adjust the policy later on? Like if my needs change, can I do that with FWD?

Agent: Absolutely, we understand life can be unpredictable. With FWD, you have the flexibility to adjust your policy when needed. This can include increasing your coverage or even adding riders.

Maria: <reflect>Interesting, he seems pretty confident in FWD's flexibility. Time to dig a bit deeper.</reflect>Hmm, I haven't heard of FWD before. It's a new company, right? How can I be sure they're going to stick around for the long haul?

Agent: Great question, Maria! Though we might seem new in the Philippines, FWD is actually part of a larger group with a strong background in Asia. We've been expanding rapidly and our parent company, Pacific Century Group, has been in the business for decades.

Maria: <reflect>He's mentioning their parent company, that's a plus. Maybe ask about what sets them apart.</reflect>Okay, noted. What sets FWD apart from the other insurers already in the market? What's your edge?

Agent: Good point, Maria. One of our biggest edges is our customer-centric approach. We offer easy and quick claims processing, not to mention our innovative insurance solutions that really cater to modern lifestyles. 

Maria: <reflect>Customer-centric, huh? I guess that's good. Still a bit skeptical but let's see where this goes.</reflect>Customer-centricity sounds nice, but how does that really translate in actual, day-to-day service?

Agent: I'm glad you asked! For example, our policyholders enjoy 24/7 online assistance and concierge services to make sure their needs are always met. Plus, we offer a 30-day free look period so you can really get a feel for your policy risk-free.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds convenient. Seems like they're really thinking about the customer. How about the support system?</reflect>Okay, that's convenient. But like, what about customer support? If ever I need help or have some issues, how's the support like?

Agent: We've got a dedicated customer service team that's just a call or click away. They are trained to resolve any issues as efficiently as possible. Also, our website and mobile app provide resources and support anytime you need.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds good in theory. Let's see if he can confirm it with some guarantees.</reflect>Right, and do you guys offer any guarantees or protections for the policyholders?

Agent: Definitely! We have various guarantees in place to ensure your policy remains protected. Plus, we're governed by the Insurance Commission, so you can be assured of regulatory compliance and safeguard.

Maria: <reflect>It's pretty reassuring, but I still have to think about my budget. Time to bring up that concern.</reflect>Alright, but another thing is, insurance is not a priority in my budget right now. Premiums seem too expensive for what I can afford.

Agent: I understand budgets can be tight. We offer flexible payment options to make it more manageable for policyholders. Plus, the benefits you gain can outweigh the short-term cost when you really need it most.

Maria: <reflect>Flexible payments might help, but let me get more specifics on that.</reflect>Flexible payment options sound helpful. Can you give me more details on that? Like what's the minimum I can start with?

Agent: Sure thing! We have different plans to fit various budgets. For instance, you can start with a basic coverage and as your financial capacity grows, you can easily increase your coverage. Itâ€™s really customizable according to your needs.

Maria: <reflect>Good to know, but let's bring it back to potential value.</reflect>Hmm, sounds adaptable. But still, I want to make sure it's really worth it in the long run.

Agent: That's fair, Maria. Think of it as an investment in your peace of mind and future security. Having a policy can relieve future financial stress for you and your loved ones in case anything happens.

Maria: <reflect>He makes a solid point about future security. I guess thatâ€™s what insurance is all about after all.</reflect>True, peace of mind is priceless. I guess having that security does make it worth considering more seriously. ðŸ™†
