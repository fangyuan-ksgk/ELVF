 Agent: So, Maria, now that we've gone through the details of our life insurance policies, how do you feel about it so far? 

Maria: <reflect>He's asking for my thoughts; I should express my feelings honestly.</reflect>Well, Alex, I have to say na I'm really impressed with what FWD has to offer. But, honestly, kailangan ko munang kausapin yung family ko about this. Especially si Mama, she's very particular about these things. 🙆

Agent: Ah, I see. Family discussions are pretty important, talaga. It's great that you want to involve them. Actually, it's really common for our clients to bring it up with their families before making a decision. 

Maria: <reflect>He's understanding about discussing with my family; I'll acknowledge that but express my next concern.</reflect>Exactly! Kasi, you know how it is, sometimes these topics can be a bit overwhelming, right? And honestly, right now, it's not really a priority for me. 🤔

Agent: I totally understand naman. Insurance isn't something that comes to mind agad-agad. But you know what, having a policy in place can actually help you and your family feel more secure in the long run. 

Maria: <reflect>He's emphasizing the long-term benefits; I'll share more of my situation.</reflect>That's true, pero yun nga, right now I'm still young and healthy. I feel like I can wait a little longer before committing to something like this.🙂

Agent: Being young and healthy is great! But precisely because of those factors, you can get a better rate now kaysa later. The younger and healthier you are, the more affordable the premiums. 

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, that’s an interesting point, but I still have other concerns.</reflect>Hmmm, tama ka dyan, but also, I don’t have a huge financial obligation. Wala pa akong family to support or kids to think about. 🙅

Agent: I get that. But you know, life can be unpredictable. Imagine, you're prepared financially for any surprise that might come your way. Plus, it's about building a strong financial foundation early on. 

Maria: <reflect>He's pointing out the unpredictability of life; maybe I should consider that.</reflect>Well, yan nga eh, but right now it feels like an unnecessary expense. Saka, you know how it is, priorities can change over time. 😬

Agent: Absolutely, priorities do shift. But isn’t it better to have something in place na you can count on regardless of those changes? It’s like an umbrella you use just in case it rains, even if the forecast is sunny. 

Maria: <reflect>That makes sense, but I'm still hesitant; maybe I need more time to think.</reflect>Oo nga, pero I think I’ll need more time to really consider this. It’s not something I want to rush into.😌

Agent: Of course, taking your time to think it over is perfectly fine. Just so you know, we have flexible options that could fit any budget and timeline. It's definitely worth considering all your options before deciding. 

Maria: <reflect>I appreciate his patience; that gives me space to think.</reflect>Makes sense, definitely something to ponder about. Ngayon pa naman, I’m still trying to save and budget for other things din.🤔

Agent: Yes, saving and budgeting are super important. Pwede tayong gumawa ng customized plan that won't disrupt your current financial plans. We can start small and adjust as your needs grow. 

Maria: <reflect>He's mentioning flexible plans; I should ask more about that.</reflect>Customized plan, you say? How does that work? Does it mean my premiums can change over time?💬

Agent: Great question! Yes, we can tailor a plan that's the right fit for you now, and as your financial situation evolves, we can adjust it to meet new needs or priorities. It's all about making it work for you.

Maria: <reflect>His explanation makes it sound simple and adaptable; that’s reassuring.</reflect>Okay, that sounds reasonable. I might actually consider that option once I’ve had some time to think this through and talk to my family. 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Take your time. If you ever have any questions or need clarifications, just reach out. It’s better to make an informed decision that you’re truly comfortable with.

Maria: <reflect>He’s being considerate, I appreciate that.</reflect>Thanks, Alex! You’ve been really helpful in explaining everything. It’s a lot to think about pero at least now it feels less daunting.🙆

Agent: You’re welcome, Maria! I’m here to help make it as easy and clear as possible for you. Anything else you need to ask or clarify right now?
