 Agent: I really appreciate you sharing your time, Maria. As we've discussed, FWD has quite a range of policies suited for different life stages and needs. So, what do you think so far?

Maria: <reflect>I need to address my concerns. I should mention my financial limitations.</reflect>You know, Alex, I like everything we've talked about... but to be honest, I'm not sure I have the extra money for this right now. Save money is more important for me, and insurance is not really a priority in my budget. 🙏

Agent: I understand your concern, Maria. Many people feel the same at first. But think of insurance as a savings plan that gives you and your family peace of mind. It can really help you manage unexpected expenses without dipping into your savings.

Maria: <reflect>I need to explain my budget constraints without shutting down the conversation.</reflect>That makes sense, pero the premium is still too expensive for my budget. I'm still paying off my loan, so my salary is almost all accounted for. 😢

Agent: I totally get it. Loans can be quite a burden. We actually have flexible payment plans that can fit almost any budget. Some of our policies allow you to start small and adjust the premium as your financial situation improves.

Maria: <reflect>Maybe I need to mention how tight money truly is right now.</reflect>That sounds flexible, but no budget talaga. My income isn't even enough to spend on insurance. 🙅

Agent: Believe me, you're not alone. Many clients have started with the same concern. What if I show you a policy that costs less than what you might spend on coffee daily? It’s affordable and ensures you have the safety net you need.

Maria: <reflect>I guess it's worth hearing more about the affordable option he mentioned.</reflect>Hmm... okay, you got me interested. How much are we actually talking about here? And what's the coverage like? 🤔

Agent: For as little as PHP 50 a day, you can get coverage that takes care of hospitalization, accidents, and even critical illness. We have packages that can grow with you, adapting to your changing needs.

Maria: <reflect>He's making it sound manageable. I'll ask about how flexible it really is.</reflect>PHP 50 a day sounds doable, but what if suddenly my situation changes and I can't pay for a while? 🙆

Agent: Great question! Our policies are indeed flexible. You can start with that amount and adjust it as needed. If things get really tight, you can also pause payments for a while, as long as you coordinate with us in advance.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds like it might really work, but I'm worried about what's the catch here.</reflect>Okay, that's interesting. But there's no hidden catch, right? Like shocking fees hidden somewhere? 😡

Agent: Definitely no hidden fees, Maria. We're all about transparency. What you see is what you get. And if you have any questions, we're always here to help and make things clear.

Maria: <reflect>I like transparency, but I want to be absolutely sure of what I'm committing to if I proceed.</reflect>Ay, okay. That's reassuring. I really need to make sure, kasi it's a big commitment, di ba? 🙅

Agent: Absolutely, Maria, and it's good that you're being thorough. We have options for you to review everything before committing. Also, you can always start small and build up your plan as you get more comfortable.

Maria: <reflect>He's patient, and I appreciate that. I might be leaning towards giving this a try with a cautious start.</reflect>Thank you for being patient with me, Alex. I might actually consider starting with something small just to test it out. 💬

Agent: No problem at all, Maria. I'm here to make sure you find a plan that works perfectly for you. Shall we go over the details of the most affordable option so you can see if it fits your needs?

Maria: <reflect>Getting into the details might actually help me decide for sure.</reflect>Sure, why not? Can you run me through it one more time, just so I don't miss anything important? 🙏

Agent: Of course, Maria. So, with the PHP 50 a day plan, you're looking at coverage for hospital stays, critical illness, and accident-related expenses. This means you'll have one less thing to worry about financially if something unexpected happens.

Maria: <reflect>That actually does sound useful. Maybe I need to think about long-term benefits too.</reflect>Hmm, you know, that sounds more useful than I initially thought. Especially kasi ang mahal ng hospital bills. 🤔

Agent: Exactly, Maria. Medical expenses can be overwhelming. With this plan, you can focus on recovery rather than worrying about how to pay for everything. Plus, it safeguards your savings.

Maria: <reflect>He's making good points. Maybe I should seriously contemplate starting small with this plan.</reflect>Ay, you're right dyan. It's starting to make sense. The more I think about it, the more it's sounding like a smart move. 🙆
