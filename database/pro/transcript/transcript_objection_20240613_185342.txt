 Agent: So Maria, just to quickly recap the benefits of our life insurance plans here at FWD: we have comprehensive coverage, attractive premiums, even options for critical illness. What do you think so far?

Maria: <reflect>Well, the benefits are indeed attractive, but I think I might not be qualified.</reflect>Ah, sige. Nakaka-impress naman talaga yung mga benefits. Kaso lang, I don't think I am allowed to get life insurance kasi I smoke. ðŸ™†

Agent: I see, Maria. Smoking shouldn't be a hindrance in getting life insurance. Sa totoo lang, may special policies kami that accommodate smokers. Of course, may kaunting adjustment lang sa premiums, but it's definitely doable.

Maria: <reflect>Interesting na hindi pala deal breaker yung smoking. But what about my medical history?</reflect>Oh talaga? That's good to know.. Pero, may history kasi ako ng illness. Hindi ba mabigat yun sa qualifications? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Actually, Maria, hindi automatic na disqualification ang history of illness. We assess it case by case. Madalas, we just need to understand the specifics of your health condition. Gagawa kami ng risk assessment based on that.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, so they're not outright rejecting people with health issues, but I'm still skeptical.</reflect>Ganun ba, Mark? So, you mean, kahit na may health history, possible pa rin? Sounds too good to be true, to be honest. ðŸ˜…

Agent: Alam mo, Maria, we aim to be as inclusive as possible. We believe na lahat deserves protection, and we try to offer solutions tailor-fit to individual needs. May special procedures kami just to make sure that our clients are well taken care of.

Maria: <reflect>This is a lot to consider. Maybe I should ask about other specific situations.</reflect>Sige... Good to hear na accommodating kayo. Pero baka may ibang scenarios ako na hindi pa covered. Like, anong coverage sa high-risk activities? ðŸ™†

Agent: Good question, Maria. For high-risk activities, meron kaming mga add-ons or riders that you can attach to your policy. Ito yung mga special clauses that give you additional coverage.

Maria: <reflect>I need more examples to better understand.</reflect>I see, add-ons. Pero siguro, maybe I can ask about specific activities like scuba diving or mountain climbing? Kasi medyo adventurous ako. ðŸ¤”

Agent: Yes, for activities like scuba diving or mountain climbing, pwede talaga ang add-ons. These activities are covered under our special clauses. 

Maria: <reflect>He's really painting a picture of a flexible policy, but let me dig deeper on plans alternative.</reflect>I appreciate the customization options, Mark. Pero to be honest, curious din ako kung ano possible options outside conventional plans. ðŸ™†

Agent: We also offer variable life plans and investment-linked insurance policies. Ito rin, customizable din siya in terms of coverage and benefits, kaya sulit!

Maria: <reflect>Flexible options sound good, but what about the premium cost?</reflect>Uy, intriguing yun ah! Pero syempre, the burning questionâ€”kamusta naman ang premiums for these plans? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Well, the premiums vary depending on the type of plan and coverage you choose. Generally, ang kagandahan sa FWD is that we offer flexible payment terms. Pwede monthly, quarterly, or even annually.

Maria: <reflect>Flexible payment terms are nice, but I need more details on cost breakdown.</reflect>Ay, mabuti naman kung flexible payments. Pero, do you have a ballpark figure or example ng typical cost for a plan na like what you've been discussing? ðŸ™†

Agent: Sure, Maria. Let's say for a basic life insurance plan with critical illness coverage, the monthly premium could start around P2,500 to P3,000.

Maria: <reflect>It's good that he's providing numbers, but I wonder if there's room for negotiation.</reflect>Okay, so P2,500 to P3,000 ang ballpark. May room for negotiating the terms or costs pa kaya, if ever? ðŸ˜…

Agent: We aim to provide the best value for our clients. While fixed ang rates ng mga plans, we can definitely explore different options within your budget para makahanap tayo ng fit.

Maria: <reflect>It's good to know they try to work within budget limits. Last specific query for better context on reliability.</reflect>I like that. Pero curious lang, compared to other insurance companies, how does FWD ensure reliability and trustworthiness? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Great question, Maria. FWD is one of the fastest-growing insurance companies in Asia. Our strength lies in our innovative approach and the strong backing of our parent company, Pacific Century Group. 

Maria: <reflect>He mentioned their reputation and backing; thatâ€™s reassuring.</reflect>That's reassuring to hear, Mark, lalo na with so many insurance companies out there. ðŸ™†
