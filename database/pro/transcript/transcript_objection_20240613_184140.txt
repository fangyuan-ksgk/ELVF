 Agent: So Maria, what do you think about our FlexiProtect policy? It definitely offers a lot of advantages and can be tailored to your needs. 

Maria: <reflect>Okay, it sounds good, but I don't want this to be another unnecessary expense na I can't justify.</reflect>Well, Alex, honestly speaking, it does sound promising. Pero, I'm just thinking na isn't it another unnecessary expense? You know how it is, gotta budget everything carefully. 🤔

Agent: I completely understand that, Maria. But think about it this way: with the right policy in place, you actually save money in the long run. It's like a safeguard for your finances.

Maria: <reflect>True, but I also have my own emergency fund, maybe di ko na kailangan nito?</reflect>Good point, pero kasi I also have my own emergency fund. Isn't that enough? 🙆

Agent: It's great that you have an emergency fund, Maria. The difference, though, is that insurance provides coverage for more significant, unforeseen events. Your emergency fund might not be sufficient for, let's say, long-term hospitalization or critical illness.

Maria: <reflect>That does make sense a bit, pero I consider myself very healthy. Maybe this isn't for me.</reflect>Hmm, maybe, pero I'm quite healthy naman. Do I really need this kind of insurance? 🙅

Agent: That's a common thought, Maria. But even the healthiest individuals can encounter unexpected health issues or accidents. It's really a way to secure your future and lessen the burden on your loved ones.

Maria: <reflect>He's persistent, and it does make sense, pero I still have to be sure this fits my budget and needs.</reflect>Okay, you have a point. But can you give me a clearer idea on how much this will cost me monthly? I need to be sure this fits my budget.🙆

Agent: Of course, Maria. The cost will depend on various factors like your age, health status, and the coverage you choose. But we can definitely customize it based on your needs and what you can afford.

Maria: <reflect>Customization sounds good, but I already have a financial advisor. Maybe this isn't necessary anymore?</reflect>Customizing is nice, but I have my own financial advisor already. Maybe this isn't necessary anymore?💬

Agent: I understand that, Maria. Having a financial advisor is great, but insurance is a specific tool that complements your financial plan. Your advisor and an insurance policy can work hand-in-hand to give you comprehensive security.

Maria: <reflect>He’s making some valid points, but I still need more convincing about the benefits.</reflect>Alright, interesting. So besides health issues, what other scenarios can this insurance help me with? 🙏

Agent: Great question, Maria. Our FlexiProtect policy covers a range of situations from accident benefits, to income protection if you're unable to work due to disability, and even education funding for your children. It's very versatile.

Maria: <reflect>Versatility sounds good, especially the education funding for my kids.</reflect>Ah, okay. The part about education funding for my kids is interesting. How does that work?🙆

Agent: Essentially, the policy allows you to allocate funds for your children’s education in the unfortunate event that something happens to you. It ensures that their future is secure and their education is uninterrupted.

Maria: <reflect>That’s reassuring, but I still need to weigh this against my budget concerns.</reflect>That's really reassuring, honestly. Sana it fits well within my budget. 🙏

Agent: Absolutely, we can definitely work out a plan that fits comfortably within your financial constraints. The goal here is to provide you with the security you need without straining your budget.

Maria: <reflect>I appreciate his consideration for my budget, but I still have my hesitation.</reflect>I really appreciate that. This is all making more sense now, pero I still need to think it over thoroughly.🤔

Agent: That’s perfectly understandable, Maria. It's always a good idea to weigh your options carefully. Just remember, this is an investment in your peace of mind and future.

Maria: <reflect>He’s giving a lot of good points, still, I have to consult with my family first.</reflect>Thanks, Alex. I'll discuss this with my family muna, para we can decide together. 🙏

Agent: I think that's a wonderful idea, Maria. It's important that your family is on board and understands the benefits too. If you have any more questions or need more clarity, feel free to reach out anytime.
