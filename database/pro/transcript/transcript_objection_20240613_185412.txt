 Agent: So, Maria, as I was saying, FWD Insurance really prioritizes flexibility and affordability in our policies. Out of curiosity, do you have any specific concerns or questions so far?

Maria: <reflect>He wants me to express any concerns. I'll mention that I smoke, which I think might be a disqualification.</reflect>Actually, I have a concern. I don't think I'm allowed to get life insurance because I smoke. Isn't that a big problem?🤔

Agent: Ah, good question, Maria. I totally understand your concern. While smoking does affect the premiums, it doesn't disqualify you for life insurance. We have options specifically tailored for smokers. Would you be interested in hearing more about those?

Maria: <reflect>Maybe he has some special policies for smokers. I should hear him out.</reflect>Oh, talaga? Okay, sige, tell me more about those options.🙆

Agent: Great! So for smokers, we offer plans that still provide ample coverage while taking into account the health risks associated with smoking. The premiums might be slightly higher than for non-smokers, but it’s definitely manageable. We've seen many clients who smoke still benefit greatly from their policies. Does that sound reassuring?

Maria: <reflect>That does sound promising, but I still have another concern about my medical history.</reflect>Okay, that sounds better. But another issue is that I have a history of illness. I’m worried that might be a problem too.🙅

Agent: Ah, I see. It’s good to be transparent about these things. The good news is that having a medical history doesn’t automatically disqualify you either. We assess each case individually and have policies that cater to different health conditions. Can you share more details about your medical history? 

Maria: <reflect>He's asking for more details. Maybe I should be specific to see what he says.</reflect>Well, I was diagnosed with hypertension two years ago. Is that a deal-breaker?🙏

Agent: Hypertension is quite common, and many of our clients have it. We do require a medical checkup to assess the current status of your health, but it's generally not a deal-breaker. We can create a policy with terms suited to your condition. 

Maria: <reflect>He seems to have answers for everything. I should see what kinds of policies they have for people like me.</reflect>Okay, so what kinds of policies do you have for someone with hypertension?🤔

Agent: We have several. For instance, there’s a policy that offers comprehensive health coverage alongside life insurance. This ensures that regular checkups and treatments for hypertension are covered. Would that be something you're looking for?

Maria: <reflect>Covering checkups and treatments sounds good, but I want to know if it's really worth it.</reflect>That sounds useful, but what if my condition gets worse? Will the policy change or adjust?🙅

Agent: Excellent question. Our policies include provisions for changing health conditions. If your hypertension gets worse, we can adjust your coverage accordingly without canceling or drastically increasing your premium. It’s all about making sure you stay covered.

Maria: <reflect>That’s reassuring. I'll ask about potential premium increases since that’s always a worry.</reflect>Will my premiums increase a lot if my condition changes?💬

Agent: There might be some adjustments, but it wouldn't be drastic. We balance our policies in such a way that ensures clients aren't overly burdened, even in the face of changing health conditions. It’s about long-term peace of mind. 

Maria: <reflect>It sounds like they've thought through a lot. I should ask if there are any additional benefits.</reflect>Okay, I'm starting to get it. Are there other benefits included in these policies?🙆

Agent: Yes, definitely. Apart from health coverage and life insurance, our plans often include outpatient benefits, wellness programs, and even discounts on pharmaceuticals. We aim to provide holistic support, not just insurance. 

Maria: <reflect>Discounts and wellness programs sound very beneficial. I'll acknowledge that.</reflect>Wow, those discounts on pharmaceuticals and wellness programs look really beneficial.🙆

Agent: I'm glad you think so. We believe in providing more than just traditional insurance coverage. Was there anything else you're wondering about? 

Maria: <reflect>He's thorough, alright. I should clarify how easy it is to use these benefits when needed.</reflect>How easy is it to actually use these benefits? Is the process straightforward?🤔

Agent: Absolutely. We make sure the process is as hassle-free as possible. You would have access to a dedicated online portal where you can manage claims, access health services, and monitor your benefits. It’s designed to be user-friendly. 

Maria: <reflect>That sounds convenient. I should see if there are any other hidden costs or fees.</reflect>That sounds very convenient. Are there any hidden costs or fees I should be aware of?🙏

Agent: Transparency is key for us, so we ensure there are no hidden fees. Any potential costs are clearly outlined in the policy documents. You’ll know exactly what you’re paying for. 

Maria: <reflect>They seem pretty transparent. I have a good feeling about this.</reflect>It sounds like you guys really prioritize transparency and customer support. That’s good to know.🙆
