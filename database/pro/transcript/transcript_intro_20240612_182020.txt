 Agent: Hi Maria! I'm Alex from FWD Insurance. Kamusta, finally nice to meet you! The traffic was no joke, right?

Maria: <reflect>He's starting off friendly, acknowledging the traffic. I should respond in kind.</reflect>Ay nako, grabe talaga! Surviving EDSA traffic everyday should come with a medal, no? ðŸ˜‚ So, ikaw, how do you deal with our everyday traffic circus?

Agent: Haha, tama ka dyan, Maria! Actually, I've become an expert in finding the best podcasts to listen to while waiting in traffic. Speaking of waiting, have you been to this fast food chain often?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to steer into a casual topic. I should engage.</reflect>Oh, yes! I'm guilty of craving their fries more often than I'd like to admit. ðŸ˜… What about you, may favorite ka ba dito?

Agent: Same here! I'm a regular for their Chickenjoy. It's my guilty pleasure. But tell me, what do you usually do when you're not surviving Manila traffic and craving fries?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking about my free time activities. I'll share a bit about myself.</reflect>Well, aside from my passion for finding the best fries, I'm actually a graphic designer. Most of my time is spent in front of a computer screen. How about you, any hobbies outside of selling insurance?

Agent: Oh, that's cool! Graphic designer, impressive! When I'm not at work, I enjoy playing basketball with friends. Keeps me active and helps burn off those Chickenjoy calories! So, have you always been into creative stuff?

Maria: <reflect>He's complimenting my profession and sharing his hobby. I'll keep it conversational.</reflect>Yes, ever since I was a kid, I'd always be drawing or making crafts. Basketball sounds fun! Do you watch any local games or just play for fun?

Agent: Mostly play for fun, but I do enjoy watching PBA games with my friends. It's a nice way to unwind. On the topic of creativity, have you worked on any interesting projects recently?

Maria: <reflect>He's shifting the conversation back to my work. I should share a recent project.</reflect>Actually, yes! I recently worked on a branding project for a local coffee shop. It was super fun and challenging. By the way, speaking of coffee, do you have any favorite coffee spots around here?

Agent: Wow, that sounds awesome! Yung result ba ma-mi-milk tea ako? As for coffee, Iâ€™ve got to say, Tim Hortons is my go-to. Their iced cappuccino is to die for. Do you lean more towards coffee or tea?

Maria: <reflect>He's talking about his preference for coffee. I'll jump in with my own preference.</reflect>I'm a total coffee addict! But I won't say no to a good milk tea every now and then. What about you, if you could only live with one, coffee or milk tea?

Agent: Tough choice, but I think I'd stick with coffee. Canâ€™t start my day without it. Speaking of days, how do you usually start yours? Any morning routines? 

Maria: <reflect>He's interested in my morning routine. I'll share mine.</reflect>I try to start my day with a quick workout and some coffee, of course! But sometimes, Iâ€™m just rushing out the door. How do you get going in the morning?

Agent: Same here with coffee! I try to get a quick run in if I can. It really wakes me up. By the way, have you ever considered how insurance might fit into your future plans, especially as a creative?

Maria: <reflect>He's segueing into insurance now. I should express some mild curiosity while keeping it light.</reflect>I've thought about it once or twice, but to be honest, I donâ€™t know much about it. Is it really something a graphic designer should think about?

Agent: Absolutely. Life insurance isnâ€™t just for one type of person or job, it's a safety net for anyone. For creatives like you, it ensures that your hard work is protected. How does the idea of financial security sound to you?

Maria: <reflect>He's making a good point. I should show mild interest without committing yet.</reflect>Financial security definitely sounds appealing. It's nice to know there are options out there. Can you tell me more about what FWD specifically offers?

Agent: Sure thing! At FWD, we offer a range of policies from life insurance to investments that grow your savings over time. We tailor our plans to fit your unique needs and goals. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in learning more about?
