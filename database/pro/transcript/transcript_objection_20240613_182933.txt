 Agent: So, Maria, as we discussed earlier, life insurance can really help secure the financial future of your loved ones. Do you have any concerns or questions so far?

Maria: <reflect>Actually, I do have a few concerns. I'll start sharing them.</reflect>Yes, kamusta, finally nice to meet you. My partner already has life insurance. So, I'm not sure if I need it too. 🤔

Agent: Oh, I see. While it’s great that your partner has life insurance, it's also important for you to have your own policy. The reason being, it ensures that you are both covered individually in case anything unexpected happens. So, hindi ka dapat mag-alala about being a burden, di ba? Have you thought about that?

Maria: <reflect>He has a point, but I have other reasons too.</reflect>I understand that, but I don't believe in insurance talaga. I feel like I'd rather invest the money elsewhere. 🙅

Agent: That’s a common thought, Maria. But life insurance can actually complement your investments. With insurance, you're protecting your investments in case something happens to you and your loved ones will still have financial stability. Investments can go up and down, but life insurance is guaranteed coverage. Does that help clear things up a bit?

Maria: <reflect>He's making sense, pero I have another concern.</reflect>Well, I still feel like it might be an unnecessary expense, especially since I'm pretty healthy. 💬

Agent: It's good that you’re healthy, Maria. That's actually the best time to get insurance—when you're healthy para mas mura ang premiums. Imagine the peace of mind it brings, knowing that even if something unexpected happens, your family won’t be financially burdened. Have you thought about who would handle the financial responsibilities if you couldn’t?

Maria: <reflect>Naku, he's right about the premiums being cheaper when healthy.</reflect>I see your point. Has this been an issue for young people like me before? 🙏

Agent: Yes, actually. I've seen many young, healthy people get insurance because they understand na hindi forever ang health natin. Also, this early start means mas malaki ang coverage for a lower cost. And think about it, less worry about the future means more time to enjoy the present. Isn't that something worth considering?

Maria: <reflect>He does have a strong argument, but I still have some hesitations.</reflect>Well, I guess it makes sense in some ways. But, then again, I think I'm saving enough on my own. I have a good emergency fund. 🙆

Agent: That’s great, Maria! Being financially responsible is always a good thing. Your emergency fund is fantastic for short-term issues, tulad ng car repairs or medical bills. Pero, life insurance is for the bigger picture. It covers major financial burdens that your emergency fund might not be able to fully handle. Have you experienced any unexpected major expenses before?

Maria: <reflect>No, not really, but his explanation makes me think twice about relying solely on my savings.</reflect>Hmm, no major ones yet, but I get what you're saying. What do FWD policies specifically cover that could benefit someone like me? 🤔

Agent: Excellent question, Maria! FWD policies cover a range of things like critical illness, accidental death, and even disability. They can also offer investment options to grow your money. This ensures that, regardless of what happens, you're getting the most out of your policy both in protection and in potential gains.

Maria: <reflect>He's really detailed about the benefits. Maybe this is something to think about more seriously.</reflect>Wow, that's a lot more comprehensive than I thought. Have you seen clients get the full benefits of such policies? 💬

Agent: Yes, definitely. I’ve had clients who unfortunately experienced major health issues or accidents, and their insurance really helped them through tough times, both financially and emotionally. Seeing their relief and knowing they had coverage makes my job so rewarding.

Maria: <reflect>Sounds like he's really helped people through tough times. Perhaps there's real value here.</reflect>It's great to know policies can really make a difference. I guess I'm just curious, what's the process if I decide to go forward with getting a policy? 🙆

Agent: It's quite simple! We'll do a quick health assessment, fill out some forms, and choose the best plan that fits your needs and budget. You'll be covered in no time. How does that sound to you?

Maria: <reflect>Seems straightforward enough. Still, I need a bit more time to think this through.</reflect>Okay, that sounds straightforward. I’ll need some time to consider this and maybe consult with my partner about it. 🙅
