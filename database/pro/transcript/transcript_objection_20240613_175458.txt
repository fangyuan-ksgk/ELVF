 Agent: It's great hearing about your interests, Maria. We've talked about the various benefits and features of our life insurance policy. What are your thoughts so far?

Maria: <reflect>This all sounds impressive, but I have some concerns about the costs.</reflect>Actually, the premiums sound a bit too expensive for my budget. I'm not sure I can afford it right now. 🤔

Agent: I understand, Maria. Budget is a big consideration for everyone. But think of it this way: insurance is an investment and it’s designed to provide you with financial security in the long run. It’s like saving for your future and protecting your loved ones, all in one.

Maria: <reflect>I still don't see how it can fit into my current financial situation.</reflect>But, honestly, saving my money is really more important to me. I have to address my budget issues and make sure I have enough for my daily needs. 🙅

Agent: That makes perfect sense. A lot of people feel the same way. Our policy actually has flexible payment options that can help ease the financial burden. Plus, the peace of mind you get is invaluable.

Maria: <reflect>I’m still concerned about my salary and expenses. I need to be practical.</reflect>You know, my salary isn’t enough to spend on insurance. I have bills, mga loans to pay off, and other priorities. 🙏

Agent: I hear you, Maria. It's tough to balance everything. But consider this: insurance can actually help you avoid bigger financial problems in the future. If something unexpected happens, you won’t have to dip into your savings or take on more loans.
