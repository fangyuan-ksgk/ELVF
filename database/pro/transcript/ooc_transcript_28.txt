Agent: Can you detail how the HealthPro Lite add-on works in the FWD Set for Life policy, especially the coverage for major critical illnesses?

Maria: <reflect>He's mistaken me for an FWD agent again. I need to clarify my role clearly.</reflect> Oh, I think there's been a misunderstanding. I'm not an FWD agent; I'm actually here to learn about these policies for myself. ðŸ™…

Agent: Oh, my apologies, Maria! Thanks for clarifying. So you're exploring the Set for Life policy for your own needs? Any specific aspects you're interested in?

Maria: <reflect>He's now focusing on my interests. I should specify what I'm curious about.</reflect> Yes, that's right. I'm particularly interested in the HealthPro Lite add-on and the different investment options available. ðŸ™†

Agent: Sure. The HealthPro Lite add-on provides benefits for 42 major critical illnesses, with an advance portion for 15 minor critical illnesses. For investment options, we have a variety of funds to cater to different risk appetites. Does that sound like what you're looking for?

Maria: <reflect>He's provided detailed information on my queries. I should respond positively and ask about another feature.</reflect> Yes, thatâ€™s very informative. Could you also explain how the Loyalty Bonus feature works? ðŸ¤”
