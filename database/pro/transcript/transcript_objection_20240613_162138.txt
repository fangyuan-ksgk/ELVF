 Agent: So, Maria, what do you think about the features we discussed? Exciting, right?

Maria: <reflect>Sounds interesting, pero I'm not yet sure. I still have some concerns.</reflect>Well, Alex, kamusta, finally nice to meet you. Actually, I'm curious about FWD. I haven't heard much about it before. Is it a new company? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Nice to meet you too, Maria! Ah, FWD is actually part of a larger group. We're relatively new in the Philippines, but we're backed by a strong global presence. We've been focusing on innovation and customer-friendly products. 

Maria: <reflect>That sounds promising, but I want to compare with others first.</reflect>Hmm, okay. Still, I want to compare products from other companies first. You know, para sure ako sa decision ko. ðŸ™†

Agent: I completely understand that, Maria. It's always good to do your research. What I can say is that FWD offers unique benefits like hassle-free claims and no medical checkups for certain plans. 

Maria: <reflect>That might be helpful. But I heard about premium increases without clear reason.</reflect>Okay, pero I've also heard about premium increases without clear reasons. Ayoko naman ng surprises like that.ðŸ™…

Agent: Great point, Maria. Sa FWD, any premium adjustments are communicated well in advance and are only done when absolutely necessary. We also have a transparent policy on how and why adjustments are made. 

Maria: <reflect>Transparency is nice. But I'd rather buy from someone I know.</reflect>Hmm, transparency is good, pero I'd still rather buy from someone I know. Mas comfortable kasi ako that way.ðŸ™…

Agent: I get that trust is a huge factor. But the good news is, with FWD, you gain access to customer service that's highly rated and always available to answer any questions you might have.

Maria: <reflect>They have strong support services, but let me ask one more question.</reflect>Okay, noted. So, can I still adjust the policy later on if I need to? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Absolutely, Maria! FWD policies are designed to be flexible. You can adjust the terms or coverage as your needs change over time. So, it's really customizable to fit your lifestyle.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds convenient. Let's explore more.</reflect>Hmm, that's interesting. I'm still trying to figure out if I really need this now. ðŸ’¬

Agent: That's perfectly okay, Maria. It's important to take your time with such decisions. Do you have any other specific concerns or questions about the policy? 

Maria: <reflect>What about hidden costs? I'm cautious about those.</reflect>Makes sense. Ano, any hidden costs with this policy? I donâ€™t want to be caught off guard with extra fees. ðŸ™†

Agent: Great question. There are no hidden costs. All fees are clearly outlined in the policy documents, so you'll know exactly what you're paying for. Transparency is key for us.

Maria: <reflect>That's a relief, but I'm still cautious about the budget.</reflect>That's good to hear. But sa mga benefits na yun, premium ba nito is expensive? I have to watch my budget din kasi. ðŸ™…

Agent: Understandable. FWD offers plans that cater to various budget ranges. We can work together to find one that fits within your financial plan without compromising on benefits.

Maria: <reflect>Budget flexibility is a plus.</reflect>Got it. Flexibility on budget sounds good. Ano pala yung pinaka-popular na plan nyo? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Our Set for Health plan is quite popular, kasi it offers comprehensive coverage with flexible premium payments. It's very adaptable to different life stages.

Maria: <reflect>Sounds tempting, but still thinking if I need this.</reflect>Tempting siya, I won't lie. Still need to wrap my head around if this is something I need right now.ðŸ’¬

Agent: I totally get that, Maria. It's a significant decision. Letâ€™s make sure every detail is clear for you so you can make a fully informed choice.

Maria: <reflect>He's patient, which is good. Still, I'm overwhelmed.</reflect>Thank you, Alex. Overwhelmed lang ako with all the info. Maybe I need to digest all of this muna.ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Take your time to review everything we discussed. I'm here to answer any questions you might have when you're ready. What part of the info was most interesting to you?
