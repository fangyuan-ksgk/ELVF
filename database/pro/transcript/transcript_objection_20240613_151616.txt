 Agent: So Maria, we’ve gone through the details of the FWD policy. Any thoughts or questions so far?

Maria: <reflect>I need to bring up the fact that I want to discuss it with my family first.</reflect>Well, honestly, I feel like I need to speak to my family about it first, you know? Big decisions like this need a bit more consultation. 🙆 

Agent: That’s totally understandable, Maria. Discussing with family is indeed important. Just curious, who in your family usually helps you with financial decisions?

Maria: <reflect>He’s interested in knowing my decision-making process within the family.</reflect>Oh, that would be my mom. She’s like the CFO of our household. Everything goes through her for approval talaga. 😂

Agent: That’s great! Moms usually have the best advice. Do you think she would be open to the benefits we discussed, like the comprehensive coverage and flexible payment terms?

Maria: <reflect>He’s emphasizing the benefits. I should express that it’s not just about my mom but it’s also about timing.</reflect>Well, not just my mom, it’s also about timing! Right now, insurance isn't one of my priorities. I feel like there are so many other things to focus on. 🙆

Agent: I see what you mean about timing. Life does get busy. However, think of insurance as a rainy day umbrella. You might not need it every day, but when it rains, you'll be glad you have it. Have you ever had an unexpected situation pop up where you wished you had something like this?

Maria: <reflect>He's making a point, but I'm still firm on thinking it's not urgent.</reflect>True, but you know, the idea is nice and all, but it’s not urgent. Maybe next time, or when it’s more convenient.🤔

Agent: I respect that. Let me just say, though, taking care of it now when you’re young and healthy could actually be more beneficial. Did you know you might get lower premiums because of good health?

Maria: <reflect>That's an interesting point, but I'll stick to my guns for now.</reflect>I've heard that, but then again, it's like—I'm still young and healthy, right? I feel like I can wait a bit longer before I need to worry about these things. 🙆

Agent: Valid point, Maria. And you know, that’s a common perception. But sometimes, being proactive can make a world of difference. Have you thought about how this could secure your financial goals early on?

Maria: <reflect>He's pushing the idea of being proactive. I need to shift the conversation slightly.</reflect>Makes sense, but right now, I feel there's no immediate rush. Besides, I’m still finding my grounding in my career. My financial priorities are a bit different, like saving up for travel or maybe even a small business. 🙆

Agent: Starting a business, that’s exciting! And insurance can actually support that dream by providing a safety net. Imagine if something were to happen, having a policy could be the cushion to keep your business afloat. Would that be something that interests you?

Maria: <reflect>He’s tying it back to my ambitions. Clever!</reflect>That’s an interesting angle, but I think I'd rather build up my savings first, and then once I have more stability, perhaps insurance will come into the picture. 🙆

Agent: Absolutely, building savings is crucial. Think of insurance as a companion to your savings; it ensures that no matter what happens, your savings stay intact for their intended purpose. Could you see the value in that?

Maria: <reflect>He’s persistent, but I need to reiterate my current stance.</reflect>Yes, I see where you're coming from, but for now, I think I'll prioritize building my savings muna before anything else. 🙏

Agent: That’s a solid plan, Maria. Saving is very important. Just keep in mind, while you’re building those savings, having a policy can make sure they aren't wiped out by unexpected events. How do you currently manage financial emergencies if they arise?

Maria: <reflect>I need to address his concern about emergencies without shifting my stance.</reflect>Well, I have an emergency fund set aside already. So far, it's been enough for the surprises that have come my way. 🙆

Agent: That’s great to hear, having an emergency fund is crucial. Insurance could be an additional layer to that safety net, making sure that your emergency fund stays untouched for the truly unexpected. 🤔

Maria: <reflect>He’s really trying to get me to see the bigger picture; I appreciate it but still sticking to my plan.</reflect>I get what you mean, Alex. But like I said, let me discuss it with my mom first and maybe try to see where it fits into our financial plan. For now, I'll prioritize other things.🙏
