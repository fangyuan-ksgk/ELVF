 Agent: So, Maria, now that we've gone over the product details, do you have any questions or concerns about our policy at FWD?

Maria: <reflect>Well, I'm not really in a hurry. I'll express that first.</reflect>Kamusta, finally nice to meet you. Anyway, you know, I'm not married and I don't have kids. So, I'm not really in a hurry to get insurance. ðŸ™†

Agent: I understand, Maria. Insurance isn't just for those with families, you know. It's also about securing your own future. Think of it as a form of self-care. How often do we prioritize ourselves, right?

Maria: <reflect>That's an interesting point, but still...</reflect>Okay, pero I'm not supporting anyone with my income. It's really just me, so why the rush? ðŸ™†

Agent: Good point, Maria. Even if it's just you, itâ€™s important to consider unexpected situations. What if something happens and you can't provide for yourself? Insurance can help cover those unexpected costs and give you peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>He's giving valid points, but I still have my doubts.</reflect>Well, parang I still want to compare products from other companies. I've heard some mixed reviews. ðŸ™†

Agent: Fair enough, it's always good to do your research. Just remember, though, some companies may not offer the flexibility and benefits that come with FWD policies. We've got features tailored to your needs which might be hard to find elsewhere.

Maria: <reflect>I should keep poking about the specifics I feel unsure about.</reflect>What if I decide later naman that I need more or less coverage? Can I adjust the policy? ðŸ™†

Agent: Our policies are quite flexible, actually. You can make adjustments as your life situation changes. Whether you need more coverage later or find you need less, we're here to help you make the necessary changes without hassle.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds good but, hmm, one more thing...</reflect>I've heard premium increases can happen without clear reasons. That's kind of a deal-breaker for me. ðŸ™†

Agent: I totally understand your concern, Maria. At FWD, we have a transparent policy regarding premiums. Any adjustments will always be communicated clearly, and we'll walk you through the reasons behind any changes.

Maria: <reflect>Alright, he's addressing my concerns well, but let's see if he can deal with one last objection.</reflect>Is there any charge if I decide to cancel the policy down the line? ðŸ™†

Agent: We believe in keeping things fair for our clients. If you ever decide that your policy isn't right for you, we have a straightforward cancellation process. We'll help you with all the necessary steps without hidden charges.

Maria: <reflect>He's really addressing my concerns thoroughly.</reflect>Hmm, that's good to know. I still feel like I need some time to think it over, though. ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Take your time. Itâ€™s an important decision and you should feel completely comfortable. If you have any more questions or doubts later, feel free to reach out.

Maria: <reflect>He's very considerate and patient. Maybe I'll ask about one feature.</reflect>You mentioned earlier about some features tailored to my needs. Can you tell me more about that? ðŸ™†

Agent: Sure, one of the standout features of our policy is the ability to customize your coverage. Whether you need critical illness coverage, accident benefits, or even a savings component, we can tailor your policy to fit those specific needs.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds useful, but I need to understand it better.</reflect>Customizable, eh? So, if my expenses change, can I also change the savings component? ðŸ™†

Agent: Definitely! The savings component of your policy can be adjusted based on your financial goals and any changes in your expenses. It's about making sure that your insurance evolves with your life circumstances.

Maria: <reflect>He's explaining it wellâ€¦ let's dig deeper.</reflect>That's quite convenient. I've always thought insurance was more rigid. How does FWD manage to offer such flexibility? ðŸ™†

Agent: We're committed to modernizing the insurance experience, Maria. By using advanced analytics and customer feedback, we've developed policies that are both comprehensive and flexible. It's part of our mission to be more responsive to peopleâ€™s real-life needs.

Maria: <reflect>SarÃ², but sounds legit.</reflect>Wow, that's a lot to take in. You guys really thought this through, huh? ðŸ™†
