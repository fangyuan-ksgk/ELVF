 Agent: Maria, I'm glad youâ€™ve taken the time to go over everything with me. Itâ€™s crucial to understand how life insurance can greatly benefit you and your loved ones.

Maria: <reflect>The details are impressive, but I have some concerns about my situation...</reflect>Hmm, medyo nagulat ako sa lahat ng details, Alex. But honestly, I think Iâ€™m saving enough naman.ðŸ¤”

Agent: Thatâ€™s understandable, kasi saving is a good start, but life insurance kasi can act as a safety net. Your savings might get depleted when unexpected expenses arise, unlike insurance na talagang designed to cover those.

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s mentioning safety, but I already have a financial advisor.</reflect>Well, to be honest, my financial advisor mentioned na okay na naman daw yung setup ko ngayon eh. I mean, I trust him din kasi. ðŸ’¬

Agent: I respect that. Maganda rin may trusted financial advisor ka na. But, life insurance can complement and protect your investments further. Itâ€™s a different layer of assurance that your assets are well-protected against life's uncertainties.

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s pushing the idea, pero healthy pa ako eh.</reflect>Okay, pero I feel like itâ€™s an unnecessary expense. I mean, healthy naman ako and kaya ko naman mag-ipon for emergencies. ðŸ™… 

Agent: I totally get that, Maria. Health can change unexpectedly, and having insurance prepares you for those changes without disturbing your financial plans. Think of it as an extra measure of security.

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s determined to address my concerns, but I donâ€™t want to overpay for something I might not need.</reflect>But Alex, I'm worried rin about overpaying for coverage Iâ€™m not sure I need at this point. ðŸ™†

Agent: A valid concern yan. Sa FWD, we offer customizable plans tailored to your needs and budget. You wonâ€™t be paying for more than what you need kasi we can adjust it according to your specific scenario and future goals.

Maria: <reflect>That makes sense, but still, how would I really benefit from this?ðŸ¤”</reflect>Sige nga Alex, paano talaga ako magbe-benefit dito in practical terms? ðŸ’¬

Agent: Good question! Practical benefits include having peace of mind knowing your family is financially secure, continuity of your financial plans even in case of unforeseen events, and less worry about healthcare expenses that your savings might not cover.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, okay, heâ€™s making a point pero investing sounds better.</reflect>I donâ€™t know, Alex, parang mas gusto ko i-invest na lang yung pera instead. ðŸ™†

Agent: Interesting point, Maria. And I agree, investing is great! Life insurance can work hand in hand with your investments. It ensures that whatever happens, you and your familyâ€™s lifestyle and financial goals can still be realized without financial strain.

Maria: <reflect>He's providing good arguments, I should ask more details.</reflect>Okay, so how does the payment plan work? Is it flexible ba, or kailangan fixed monthly? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Flexible siya, Maria. You can choose monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or even annual payments depending on what suits your financial flow. Our goal is to provide you with convenience along with assurance.

Maria: <reflect>That flexibility is interesting, letâ€™s see if it fits more scenarios.</reflect>Ah, ganun ba? How about if I decide to pay early or gusto kong mag-change ng plan, madali lang ba yun? ðŸ’¬

Agent: Yes, of course. You can always pay early without penalties, and revising your plan is also straightforward. We aim to continuously meet your changing needs at any stage of your life.

Maria: <reflect>Thatâ€™s good to know, especially since things as dynamic.</reflect>Thatâ€™s reassuring. Ang bilis kasing magbago ng priorities and needs. ðŸ™†

Agent: Exactly, and having a customizable insurance plan ensures that you stay aligned with your evolving goals. Weâ€™re here to make sure you have the right protection at the right time.

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s definitely thorough, but I should consider this more.</reflect>Okay, youâ€™ve made good points, Alex. I will definitely think about it more. Teka lang, is there any penalties if I decide to stop the coverage? ðŸ™†

Agent: Thereâ€™s no severe penalty for stopping. However, itâ€™s crucial to note the effects on the benefits. You may get less value compared to continuously paying, but we can discuss options should you decide thatâ€™s best for you.
