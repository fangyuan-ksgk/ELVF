 Agent: So Maria, as I mentioned, our policies offer comprehensive coverage and numerous benefits. Any thoughts so far?

Maria: <reflect>I've gotten the info; now I should express why I might not need it.</reflect>Well, to be honest, I really think it's better to just save money in the bank and earn interest. Don't you think so?🤔

Agent: I get that, Maria, and saving in the bank is indeed important. But have you considered that the interest rates can be quite low? A life insurance policy, on the other hand, provides both financial protection and growth through investment options that can offer higher returns.

Maria: <reflect>He has a point, but another concern is my partner already has life insurance.</reflect>Okay, pero kasi my partner already has life insurance. So, hindi ko sure if kailangan pa namin ng additional. 🤔

Agent: That's a valid point. But think of it this way—having your own policy ensures your personal financial security. In case something happens to you, your partner won’t have to shoulder all the financial burdens. It’s really about protecting both yourselves financially.

Maria: <reflect>Well, I also think I'm healthy and don't need it.</reflect>I see. But honestly, I'm in pretty good health, so parang unnecessary expense lang for me. 🙅

Agent: I understand that being healthy is a big plus, Maria. But consider that unforeseen accidents or illnesses can happen anytime, and having insurance can provide the necessary financial support during those unexpected moments.

Maria: <reflect>He's making sense, but I also think having my own emergency fund is enough.</reflect>Okay, gets ko naman yan. But I think having my own emergency fund is enough to cover those incidents. 🙆

Agent: Having an emergency fund is great, Maria, but what if it gets exhausted or doesn't cover all expenses? Insurance acts as a safety net, ensuring that your savings aren't depleted in times of need. 

Maria: <reflect>This is interesting, pero... I still have reservations.</reflect>That's a good point din, pero... I have to think more about it. 😬

Agent: Of course, Maria. Making an informed decision is important. How about I provide some scenarios or case studies where other clients found the insurance beneficial? 

Maria: <reflect>He might get into storytelling; I think I can listen to that.</reflect>Sure, that might help. I'm curious to hear those stories. 👍

Agent: Great! So, one of my clients was once in a similar situation, healthy, with savings. But after an unexpected medical emergency, the insurance really came through and covered the costs without them having to dip into their savings.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds impactful, but I'll stay skeptical for now.</reflect>That's quite an example. But don't you think those situations are also rare? 🙄

Agent: They might seem rare, but they're more common than you'd expect, Maria. Another client faced a layoff, and their insurance policy helped them sustain their standard of living until they found another job. It isn't just about health; it's about financial stability.

Maria: <reflect>He's expanding the benefits; I see where he's coming from.</reflect>Okay, I get it. So it's more than just health coverage, right? 🤔

Agent: Exactly, it's about securing your financial future in multiple aspects. It gives you peace of mind knowing that whatever life throws at you, you and your loved ones are protected.

Maria: <reflect>He's covering all bases, but I still worry about overpaying.</reflect>My concern din kasi is overpaying for something I might not fully need. 🙆

Agent: That's understandable. Our policies are customizable to fit your budget and specific needs. You don’t have to commit to a plan that's too extensive; we can tailor it to what you think is necessary.

Maria: <reflect>He's being flexible; that's nice.</reflect>That's good to know. Customizable coverage sounds more reasonable. 🙂

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. My goal is to ensure you’re comfortable and get the most value out of your investment. Any specific concerns you have for us to address with this insurance?

Maria: <reflect>He's being thorough; I'll see what else I need clarification on.</reflect>I think you’ve covered a lot of my concerns. Let me think about this and see if I can come up with any other questions. 💬
