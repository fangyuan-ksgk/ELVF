 Agent: Finally, nice to meet you and kamusta, Maria! Thanks for sticking with our discussion. I hope it wasn't too overwhelming. So far, do you have any thoughts or questions about our policy?

Maria: <reflect>I want to express that I'm not in a hurry to decide and probably need some time to discuss with my family.</reflect>Honestly, Alex, it's all very interesting, pero I think I need to speak to my family muna before I decide. Not to mention, I'm still young and healthy pa naman. ðŸ™†

Agent: I understand, Maria. Itâ€™s always a good idea to discuss major decisions with family. Although, one thing to consider is that life insurance policies actually offer better rates when you're younger and healthier. Kapag tumanda tayo and health risk increases, mas mataas na ang premiums. 

Maria: <reflect>He's making a good point about rates but I still don't feel the urgency.</reflect>Hmm, I see your point. Pero right now, it's really not a priority for me. Parang I have other expenses pa to think about. ðŸ¤”

Agent: Thatâ€™s totally fair, Maria. We all have different priorities. But think of it this way, having a policy early on can act as a financial safety net for your future expenses, so you can handle those with more peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to show long-term benefits, but I still feel no rush.</reflect>Yeah, I get it. Pero now is not a good time talaga. Parang ang daming nangyayari. Maybe next time? ðŸ™…

Agent: For sure, life can get really busy. Whatâ€™s interesting, though, is that once you have your policy in place, itâ€™s one less thing to worry about. Parang setting it aside and knowing it's there if and when you need it.

Maria: <reflect>He's persistent, and it makes sense, but I'm still not convinced it's my priority.</reflect>True, but as I said, I'm not supporting anyone with my income pa naman. So it doesn't feel urgent. ðŸ™†

Agent: That makes sense. Being young and single does give you some time. Have you considered, though, using the policy as a form of investment? It can grow over time, and you might find it beneficial later.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds like a new angle, but I'm still hesitant.</reflect>Hmm, that does sound interesting. But how much do you think I should be investing? Curious lang. ðŸ™†

Agent: It really depends on what you'd be comfortable with and what goals you have. Some people start with a smaller premium and then adjust it as they go. We can find something that fits within your budget and goals.

Maria: <reflect>He's making it sound flexible, which is good, but I still feel cautious.</reflect>Adjustable sounds good. Pero I heard about premium increases without clear reasons. Baka mangyari yun, kaya I'm worried. ðŸ™¸

Agent: That's a good point to raise, Maria. Transparency is important. At FWD, we make sure that any adjustments are clearly communicated. We also offer policies that have fixed premiums to avoid unexpected changes.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds a bit reassuring, but I'm still not sure.</reflect>That's good to know. But do I have the option to adjust the policy later on if my needs change? Entertaining lang talaga while my family takes their time. ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely, we can definitely look into flexible options for you. Our goal is to make sure the policy grows with you and your life changes.

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing flexibility, and it does seem like a good option.</reflect>I appreciate that, Alex. Maybe I should think about it a bit more. But your patience is really making it easier for me to understand. ðŸ™†

Agent: I'm glad to hear that, Maria. It's our commitment to our clients to make sure you fully understand and feel comfortable. While you take your time to discuss with your family, I'm always here for any questions you have.

Maria: <reflect>He's very accommodating, which I like.</reflect>Thank you, Alex. It'll help to run this by them. I'm just super cautious lang eh. ðŸ™†

Agent: And that's perfectly okay. Kaya away, take all the time you need. Weâ€™re here to assist when youâ€™re ready. Anything else you'd like to know, while we're at it?

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s pushing for more information sharing.</reflect>Not for now, but I'll definitely keep your points in mind. You know, mas maganda if everything's clear when I present it to them. ðŸ™†

Agent: Great, I'm happy you feel that way! Whenever you're ready, feel free to reach out. We can even have another discussion with your family if that helps clarify things.

Maria: <reflect>He's very helpful about involving my family, which is thoughtful.</reflect>You've got a deal, Alex! We'll see lang how their schedules go. ðŸ™†

Agent: Wonderful. Thanks again, Maria. Looking forward to whenever youâ€™re ready. Anything else you might want help with while we're still here?

Maria: <reflect>He's keeping the conversation open, which is nice.</reflect>None for now, thanks Alex. This conversation has been really informative. ðŸ™†
