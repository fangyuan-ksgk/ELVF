 Agent: Kamusta, finally nice to meet you. So, Maria, we've gone through quite a bit about what FWD Insurance can offer. Any thoughts or concerns so far?

Maria: <reflect>I'll raise some concerns and questions regarding trust-related issues.</reflect>You know, Alex, I have a few concerns. Like, I haven't really heard of FWD before. Is it a new company? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Oh, I get you! Actually, FWD's been around since 2013, and weâ€™re part of the Pacific Century Group which has been in business for over 20 years. We're definitely not a newbie! But I understand, it's important to be cautious. What else is on your mind?

Maria: <reflect>I'll ask about the common trust issues related to premium increases.</reflect>Okay, got it. But, I also heard some stories about insurance companies increasing premiums without clear reasons. Is that something I should worry about with FWD?

Agent: Thatâ€™s a very valid concern, Maria. At FWD, transparency is super important to us. We clearly outline any possible premium adjustments in our policies, and we're committed to being upfront about any changes. Did that help ease your worries a bit?

Maria: <reflect>I'll mention another trust issue regarding policy flexibility.</reflect>I see, that's good to know. But what about adjusting the policy later on if I need to? I've heard some insurance companies can be really strict with that. ðŸ™…

Agent: Absolutely, flexibility is key! FWD offers plans that you can customize as your needs change. Weâ€™re quite customer-centric, so we aim to make adjustments as smooth and hassle-free as possible. Do you have any specific adjustments youâ€™re thinking about?

Maria: <reflect>I'll try to see if there are any hidden catches.</reflect>Good to hear! And, sorry if I'm sounding nitpicky, pero honest question lang talagaâ€”are there any hidden catches or fine print na we need to be worried about?

Agent: No worries, Maria! It's always good to ask. FWD prides itself on being straightforward. Our goal is really to provide you with clear, easy-to-understand policies. And, of course, I'm here to explain anything you're unsure about. Any other concerns?

Maria: <reflect>I should confirm what he said earlier.</reflect>Okay, perfect. So, If ever I need further clarification, you're the one I should contact, right?ðŸ™†

Agent: Thatâ€™s right! Iâ€™m just a call or text away. Even our customer service team is top-notch and ready to assist you with any concerns. I want you to feel secure and well taken care of.

Maria: <reflect>Maybe I should ask something a bit more personal to get a better feel of him as my potential insurance agent.</reflect>Alright. By the way, how long have you been with FWD? ðŸ¤”

Agent: I've been with FWD for about five years now, and itâ€™s been an incredible journey! I've helped many clients find the right coverage.

Maria: <reflect>I'll share something a bit about myself to balance the convo and then get back to my main concern.</reflect>Ah, that's great. I've been with my current company for almost the same period! Anyway, back to the policyâ€”how soon can I expect the coverage to start once we finalize everything?

Agent: Good question! Once your application is approved, coverage can start as soon as you make your initial premium payment. Some policies even offer immediate coverage for certain benefits. 

Maria: <reflect>That sounds pretty efficient! I should let him know heâ€™s addressing my concerns well.</reflect>Wow, thatâ€™s efficient. Youâ€™re addressing my concerns really well, Alex. 

Agent: Thank you, Maria! Your peace of mind is my priority. Anything else you'd like to know about the policy or FWD in general?

Maria: <reflect>I'll ask about the claims process.</reflect>How about the claims process? Is it straightforward or are there a lot of hoops to jump through?

Agent: Great question! We've streamlined our claims process to be as smooth and simple as possible. You can even submit claims online, and our team works hard to ensure quick and hassle-free payouts. 

Maria: <reflect>He seems confident about FWD, I should gauge his view on customer satisfaction.</reflect>Thatâ€™s reassuring. How about feedback from your current clients? Any testimonials you can share?

Agent: Glad you asked! We actually have a lot of positive testimonials from clients who appreciate our straightforward approach and excellent customer service. I can share some with you if youâ€™re interested.

Maria: <reflect>I should keep it light and conversational now but still steer toward any remaining doubts.</reflect>Wow, sounds like youâ€™ve got happy customers! But I guess itâ€™s still natural to have some doubts.ðŸ¤”

Agent: Absolutely, having doubts is completely natural. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re here to ensure that all your concerns are addressed before making any big decisions. What else is on your mind?
