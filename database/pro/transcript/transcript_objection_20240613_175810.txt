 Agent: So, Maria, what do you think about the products we've discussed so far? 

Maria: <reflect>He wants to know if I'm interested, but I have to mention my budget concerns.</reflect>Honestly, Alex, the plans sound great, pero I'm really worried about the cost. Alam mo naman, saving money is more important right now.🤔

Agent: I understand, Maria. Saving is indeed important. But think of insurance as a form of saving rin—you're setting aside a little bit each month to ensure you're covered for future uncertainties. Have you considered how it could actually save you more in the long run?

Maria: <reflect>Point taken, but I need him to address more of my financial concerns.</reflect>Tama ka dyan, pero insurance is not a priority in my budget currently. My salary is not enough to spend on insurance, lalo na with all other expenses.🙏

Agent: I get it, budgeting is tough. We do have flexible options that might fit your financial situation better. We could customize a plan so it fits comfortably within your budget. How does that sound?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to be helpful, but I still have concerns.</reflect>Hmm, okay, but the premium is too expensive for my budget, especially since I'm still paying off my loan. Paano yan?🙅

Agent: That's a valid concern, Maria. We have payment plans that could help spread out the cost, making it easier to manage alongside your loan payments. We aim to be as accommodating as possible for people in situations like yours. Have you ever considered such flexible arrangements before?

Maria: <reflect>Flexible payment is interesting, but I need to know more.</reflect>Not really, kasi I always thought the premiums are fixed and non-negotiable. How flexible are these payment plans exactly? 🤔

Agent: They are quite flexible! We can set up a monthly, quarterly, or even annual payment scheme based on what works best for you. It’s all about making sure you're comfortable and supported.

Maria: <reflect>He's making it sound doable, but I still worry about overcommitting financially.</reflect>I appreciate the options, but I'm still not convinced. What happens if I suddenly can't keep up with the payments?🙅

Agent: Good question! We do have options for those scenarios, like a grace period if you miss a payment. Plus, you can adjust your coverage if needed. It's not set in stone; we want you to feel secure without feeling pressured.

Maria: <reflect>Having a grace period and the ability to adjust sounds reassuring.</reflect>Okay, that makes sense. Maybe I should think about it more. By the way, what if I move abroad? Will my coverage still apply? 🙆

Agent: Absolutely, your coverage would still be in effect, even if you move abroad. Our policies are designed to offer protection regardless of your location. So, you get global peace of mind!

Maria: <reflect>He's covering a lot, but I still need to be completely certain before committing.</reflect>Wow, that's good to know. One last thing, what’s the process if I need to claim something? Is it easy and straightforward? 🤔

Agent: Glad you asked! The claim process is streamlined to be as hassle-free as possible. We offer support through every step, whether online or through an advisor, making sure you don’t face hassles during what could already be a stressful time.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds reassuring, but I need to weigh this more.</reflect>That’s a relief to hear talaga. I need to review everything and see if my budget can really fit this in. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.🙏
