 Maria: <reflect>The product seems interesting, but I really don't have much money...</reflect> Alam mo ba, I really appreciate all the info you shared, but honestly, saving money is more important to me right now. 😔

Agent: I understand, Maria. Saving money is indeed important. One great thing about our policy is that it's flexible, and you can choose a plan that fits your budget. Did you know that even a small policy can make a big difference?

Maria: <reflect>I still don't think I have enough money to spare for insurance.</reflect> That sounds nice, pero to be honest, my salary is often just enough for my basic expenses, especially since I'm still paying off my loan.🙅

Agent: I hear you, and that's a common concern. One angle you might consider is that having insurance can provide a safety net, so you don't have to worry about unexpected expenses affecting your budget even more. 

Maria: <reflect>This sounds logical but paying premiums still seems expensive.</reflect> Hmm, that makes sense, but I've always heard the premiums are quite expensive. Can you explain how the premiums work, especially if my budget is really tight? 🤔

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Our policies are designed to be accessible and sustainable. We even have options where you can pay monthly premiums that are surprisingly affordable. Plus, some plans offer returns that can help you build up savings for the future.

Maria: <reflect>Affordable sounds good, still hesitant since I'm really tight on budget...</reflect> My budget is very tight, I'm not sure if I can commit to monthly premiums even if they're affordable. 🙅

Agent: That's a straight-to-the-point concern, Maria, and it's valid. You could start with a basic plan and increase your coverage as your financial situation improves. Plus, you'll have peace of mind knowing you're covered even at a basic level.

Maria: <reflect>Basic plan sounds more manageable, but I still want to save money...</reflect> Okay, a basic plan does seem more manageable, pero I'm also thinking that putting my money in a savings account might be better. 🙆

Agent: That's a practical approach, Maria. But think of it this way, insurance ensures that your savings won't be depleted by unexpected expenses, especially medical costs. Your savings are protected that way.

Maria: <reflect>His point about protected savings makes sense, but I'm really cautious about additional expenses.</reflect> Hmm, okay, but I'm really cautious about any additional expenses. I don't want to overcommit and strain my budget further. 🤔

Agent: That's perfectly understandable, Maria. We can work together to find a plan that's just right for you, without overcommitting. We can even explore options where part of your premiums can come back to you as savings or investment returns. 

Maria: <reflect>This really makes sense, but I still have doubts...</reflect> That’s interesting and useful, definitely. But I still have doubts because my budget is already tight... 💬

Agent: It’s natural to have doubts, Maria. Let's build a customized plan that fits your financial situation right now. We can adjust it as your circumstances improve. And know that peace of mind can sometimes be the best investment. 

Maria: <reflect>Customized plan sounds assuring, but budget tightness worries me.</reflect> A customized plan does sound assuring, but I'm still worried about continuously fitting it into my tight budget... 🙆

Agent: Your worry is valid, Maria. We're here to make sure the plan works for you, not the other way around. We can set a review point to ensure the plan is still within your comfort zone and adjust accordingly. 

Maria: <reflect>He’s really patient and accommodating. Maybe this could work out better than I expected.</reflect> I appreciate how patient and accommodating you are. Maybe it could work out better than I thought, but I need more time to think. 🙏

Agent: Take all the time you need, Maria. This is a big decision and you shouldn't rush it. I'm here to answer any further questions you might have and help you make the best choice for yourself.
