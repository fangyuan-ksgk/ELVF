 Agent: So, Maria, I hope all the details about the policy I shared with you were helpful. What do you think so far?

Maria: <reflect>I'm not in a hurry to get insurance. I should mention that before anything else.</reflect>You know, Alex, I think the policy is quite interesting and beneficial nga. But right now, I really don’t feel the urgency to get insurance. I mean, I’m still young and healthy naman. 🤔

Agent: I completely understand, Maria. It's great to hear that you're healthy! But wouldn't it be even better to secure your future while you're in the best possible health? This ensures that you lock in a lower premium and won't have to worry about coverage later on.

Maria: <reflect>He does make a good point, but I'm still not convinced about the urgency.</reflect>That's true, but, right now, insurance just doesn't feel like a priority for me. I need to speak to my family about it din kasi. 🙅

Agent: Of course, discussing it with family is important. Can I ask, what kind of feedback do you think they might give? Sometimes, having insurance can be something they see as a really positive step forward for you.

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to get me to think about my family's perspective. I should be honest about that too.</reflect>Honestly, they're very practical, so they might think na it's not urgent, especially since wala pa akong mga dependents. In my opinion this is just an additional cost for me today. 🙆‍♀️

Agent: I hear you, Maria. Many people your age feel the same way. Would you believe, though, that getting coverage early can save you more in the long run? Plus, it’s an investment that can provide you peace of mind, and maybe even give your family a sense of security too.

Maria: <reflect>He's talking about savings and peace of mind. Maybe I should ask more about these benefits.</reflect>Okay, you mentioned savings and peace of mind. Could you expound on how I can really save more and feel more secure with this policy? 🤔

Agent: Absolutely. Since you're young and healthy, you qualify for a lower premium, which means you pay less every month compared to if you get insurance later in life. Over the years, these premiums are much more affordable. As for peace of mind, it's knowing that you're financially protected against unpredictable events.

Maria: <reflect>It does sound practical when he puts it that way. But still, I'm not sold completely.</reflect>That does make sense, Alex. But like I said, I don't find it urgent ngayon. I also have other priorities. Maybe next time na lang? 🙆‍♀️

Agent: I respect that, Maria. It's always good to make informed decisions. However, it's also important to consider that we can never really predict when we'll need it. It's like an umbrella; it's better to have it before it starts raining, di ba?

Maria: <reflect>He's making an analogy. I get it, but still... there are so many things on my plate right now.</reflect>I understand your point. It's like having an umbrella just in case. Pero ang dami ko kasi iniisip ngayon and insurance is not on top. 🤔

Agent: Totally get it, Maria. Life can feel super packed, for sure. If I might add, our policies can be flexible to fit your budget and lifestyle. We offer different plans that might not feel like an added burden but more of a smart choice.

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to meet me halfway. Maybe I should ask about the flexibility part more.</reflect>Flexible, you say? Pwede ko bang malaman in what ways these plans are flexible? How can they adapt to my current situation? 💬

Agent: Sure! For example, we offer policies with lower monthly premiums that can increase gradually as your income grows. Plus, there are options for customization so you only pay for the coverage you actually need. It’s about tailoring it to fit you.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds more manageable. But I still need to think this through more.</reflect>Okay, I see the potential in that flexibility. But still, a policy is a long-term commitment, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for that malaking commitment now. 🤔

Agent: Understandable, commitment can be daunting. However, think of it as setting a strong foundation for the future. Small steps now can ease the burden later. Is there something specific holding you back from considering a policy at this point?

Maria: <reflect>He’s asking what’s holding me back. Should I just be direct about my priorities?</reflect>Honestly, it’s just that I have other financial priorities right now. Insurance doesn’t feel like the smartest move for me with all these bills and savings goals I have. 🙆‍♀️

Agent: I completely get that, and your transparency is invaluable. But what if I told you that starting small with insurance wouldn't hamper your current priorities, and could actually help you manage your finances better over the coming years?

Maria: <reflect>He’s suggesting insurance won't ruin my budget. I should ask a practical question to clarify.</reflect>Okay, so if I start small, what amount are we talking about here monthly? I need to know if it's really feasible. 🤔

Agent: Great question! Given your current status, we could start with a very basic plan at around PHP 500 to PHP 1,000 monthly. This wouldn't strain your budget but would still provide invaluable protection.

Maria: <reflect>If it's that low, it might actually be doable. But still, let me buy some time.</reflect>Hmmm, that does sound manageable, Alex. But like I said earlier, kailangan ko pa rin pag-isipan talaga. I want to make sure I'm making the best financial decision. 🙏
