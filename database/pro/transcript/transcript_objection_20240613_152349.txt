 Agent: Kamusta, finally nice to meet you here, Maria! Has the traffic been kind to you today?

Maria: <reflect>I should acknowledge his comment and share a bit about my day.</reflect>Oh, Alex, the traffic was crazy as usual, but I'm glad I finally made it here. How about you, ready to dive into insurance world? ðŸ˜‚

Agent: Oh yes, more than ready! So we've covered the basics of our life insurance plans, and I noticed you had a few concerns about getting insured right now. Can we discuss those a bit more?

Maria: <reflect>I should mention my concerns about timing and urgency.</reflect>Honestly, Alex, now is not a good time for me. I mean, it's not urgent for me to get insurance, diba?ðŸ™†

Agent: I totally understand, Maria. Many feel it's not urgent, especially when they're young and healthy. But have you ever considered the long-term peace of mind it can bring?

Maria: <reflect>I'll share that I feel too young and healthy to worry about it now.</reflect>Yeah, but I feel like I'm still young and healthy. Why should I worry about something like this at my age? ðŸ™…

Agent: That's a good point, Maria. And it's great that you're healthy. But precisely because you're healthy, the premiums are much lower. It's more about planning for the future. Ever thought of it that way? 

Maria: <reflect>Thinking of reasoning about my current life situation.</reflect>True, but I'm not married, no kids, it's just me right now. It feels like an over-preparation. ðŸ™…

Agent: I get that, Maria. But sometimes, life throws unexpected events our way. Having a policy could make future planning easier if your situation changes. Plus, it's an investment in yourself!

Maria: <reflect>Let me express my non-urgent feeling and financial prioritization.</reflect>You're right, but it still feels like something I can think about later. I've got other things to focus on like saving money and budgeting. ðŸ™…

Agent: I totally get your point there, Maria. Life insurance doesn't have to break the bank, though. We can find something that fits your budget without compromising your savings. How does that sound?

Maria: <reflect>Trying to understand how he plans to make it fit my budget.</reflect>Really? How can you make it fit my budget, though?ðŸ¤”

Agent: Good question! We offer flexible premiums and different plan options so you can choose one that's manageable for you. It's really about finding what suits you best. Can I show you some examples?

Maria: <reflect>I should let him show the options but still keep a bit of resistance.</reflect>Alright, I'm curious. What do you have in mind, Alex? ðŸ™†

Agent: Great! Let's say you start with our basic plan, the premiums are quite affordable and it offers essential coverage. As your needs change, you can adjust it. What do you think?

Maria: <reflect>Considering but still cautious about over-commitment.</reflect>Hmm, it does sound practical, but I still need to be sure it's worth it. I don't want to overpay for coverage I might not need.ðŸ¤”

Agent: That's a smart way to look at it, Maria. Our policies are designed to be as flexible and customizable as possible. Plus, you can always reassess and make changes as life goes on.

Maria: <reflect>Reflecting on how flexible and beneficial it could be, but still keeping a watch on my finances.</reflect>Okay, I see your point there. But are there any hidden clauses or sudden premium increases that I need to be wary of?

Agent: I'm glad you asked that, Maria. With FWD, we're transparent about our fees and premiums. Any adjustments are clearly communicated. We strive to ensure there are no surprises for our clients.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds reassuring but I still have to be cautious. I should mention my budget concerns again.</reflect>Alright, sounds fair. But again, if it's too costly, it won't work for me at all. Saving money is a priority right now. ðŸ™†

Agent: Completely understandable. Let's tailor it to what's affordable for you. We have more affordable options without sacrificing essential coverage. Shall we take a look at those?

Maria: <reflect>Agree to see more options but keeping my cautious stance.</reflect>Sure, show me what you've got. I'm interested but still on the fence about it. ðŸ¤”

Agent: Perfect, Maria. Let's explore the options that will make you comfortable without compromising your financial goals. You'd be surprised at how affordable protection can be.

Maria: <reflect>Been open but practical about it.</reflect>Alright, lead the way, Alex. I'm listening. ðŸ™†

Agent: Great! So to give you an idea, let's start with the most budget-friendly option... (continues explaining options)...
