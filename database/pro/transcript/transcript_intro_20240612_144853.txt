 Maria: <reflect>He's been really light-hearted so far, so I'll continue that tone and ask about his work.</reflect>So Alex, Iâ€™m pretty sure you're a Makati traffic expert by now, but whatâ€™s it like working at FWD? Do you get traffic hazard pay? ðŸ˜‚

Agent: Haha, I wish! At FWD, every day is like braving EDSA trafficâ€”challenging but rewarding. And our office is like a pit stop, always bustling but also a place to recharge. What about you, ever thought about getting into the insurance world?

Maria: <reflect>He's making a playful comparison of his work and traffic. I'll share a bit about my job in return.</reflect>Well, I already juggle enough oranges as a graphic designer, so I guess I'm good! But hey, what's the funniest thing that happened at work? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Oh, there are a ton! Once, during a serious presentation, our boss accidentally played a cat video from YouTube. The whole room went from business mode to "awww" mode in seconds. How's that for a meeting icebreaker? So, what's your secret to surviving long design sessions?

Maria: <reflect>Thatâ€™s hilarious! I should share a funny work story too.</reflect>Thatâ€™s a good one! Once, I accidentally sent a meme to a client instead of their design. Luckily, they found it funny! My secret? A playlist of 80â€™s hits and lots of coffee. What about you, any work hacks? ðŸ˜‚

Agent: I live for coffee too, but my hack is rewarding myself with a treat after each call. Itâ€™s like trick-or-treat but for adults! So, how did you end up in graphic design? Always been an artist?

Maria: <reflect>He's curious about my background, so I'll share a bit.</reflect>Sort of! I've been doodling since I learned to hold a crayon. Eventually, I figured I'd get paid for my doodles. What about you? Did you always want to be a financial superhero? ðŸ˜‚

Agent: Haha, financial superhero, I like that! Actually, I wanted to be a rockstar but then realized I needed some financial stability first. So here I am, rocking insurance plans! Ever thought about your Plan B, if not a designer?

Maria: <reflect>He's sharing his Plan B; I should play along and share mine.</reflect>If not a designer, I'd probably be a comedy writer. Laughter makes the best designs, right? But rockstar financial advisor, thatâ€™s legendary! Any rockstar moments in your career? ðŸ˜‚

Agent: Well, closing a big deal feels pretty rockstar, but nothing beats making a client laugh during a serious talk. Once, I clinched a deal by comparing insurance policies to types of pizza. By the way, what's your favorite pizza topping?

Maria: <reflect>He's keeping it fun! Let's play along.</reflect>Oh, definitely pepperoni with extra cheese. Can't go wrong with the classics. Insurance and pizza, what a combo! Ever thought of opening an insurance-themed pizzeria? ðŸ˜‚

Agent: If that ever happens, you get free pizza for life! Insurance with a side of pepperoni? People might just buy into that. So, drawing all day, do you ever sneak in doodles of your clients?

Maria: <reflect>He's keeping the humour going. I'll respond with something playful.</reflect>Haha, sometimes! But only as stick figures, nothing too fancy. Secretly, all my doodles wear superhero capes. How about you, ever draw clients into your daily logs? ðŸ˜‚

Agent: Only in my dreams, and they always sign up for the most epic policies! Speaking of epic, do you ever get a chance to work on massive projects or something just mind-blowingly creative?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking about my work projects. Let's keep the tone light.</reflect>Sometimes I get to work on big campaigns, which is awesome! It's like creating a blockbuster movie poster, but for a brand. Ever feel like you're in a movie while pitching insurance? ðŸ˜‚

Agent: Absolutely, especially when a dramatic soundtrack plays in my head during the pitch! Itâ€™s like James Bond, but with paperwork. If you were a movie character, who would you be?

Maria: <reflect>Playing along with the movie theme.</reflect>I'd be a mix of The Joker and Daenerys. Chaos with dragons. Just kidding! More like someone from a rom-com, you know, quirky but cute. How about you? Double-oh-investment? ðŸ˜‚

Agent: Haha, I love it! Letâ€™s go with Double-oh-Advisor. Saving the world, one policy at a time. It beats traffic jams and cat videos any day. Soâ€¦ any superpowers besides juggling oranges and making amazing designs?
