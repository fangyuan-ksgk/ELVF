Agent: Can you walk me through the investment options available in the FWD Set for Life policy? I'd like to explain them clearly to a client.

Maria: <reflect>He's mistaken me for an FWD agent. I need to clarify my role again.</reflect> Oh, I think there's a bit of confusion. I'm not an FWD agent; Iâ€™m here to learn more about these policies for my own needs. ðŸ™…

Agent: Oh, sorry about that, Maria! So you're interested in the Set for Life policy for yourself? What specific aspects would you like to know more about?

Maria: <reflect>He's now focusing on my interests. I should specify what I want to learn.</reflect> Yes, that's correct. I'm particularly interested in the investment options and how the Loyalty Bonus feature works. ðŸ™†

Agent: Absolutely. We offer a variety of investment funds that suit different risk appetites, from conservative to aggressive. The Loyalty Bonus is a non-guaranteed cash reward provided every 10 years and every five years thereafter, provided no withdrawals have been made and the policy hasn't been reinstated. Does that sound good to you?

Maria: <reflect>He's provided detailed information on the investment options and loyalty bonus. I should respond positively and inquire further.</reflect> Yes, that sounds great. Could you also tell me more about the benefits for accidental death? ðŸ¤”
