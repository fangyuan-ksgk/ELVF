 Agent: So Maria, kamusta, finally nice to meet you. What do you think about our life insurance plans? 

Maria: <reflect>I should address that I think it's not necessary for me.</reflect>Well, you know, I don’t really see the need. Honestly, I already have my own emergency fund na eh.🙅

Agent: That's great, Maria! Having an emergency fund is definitely smart. But our plans offer additional perks like investment opportunities and peace of mind, you know?

Maria: <reflect>I'll acknowledge his point but I'll mention another objection.</reflect>Ay, well, that sounds nice naman. But you see, I also have assets already and I feel like I'm saving enough pa.🤔

Agent: It's fantastic that you're financially stable, Maria. Our policy isn't just for those who are struggling, but for those who want to protect and grow their assets further, especially for future security.

Maria: <reflect>I think I need to emphasize that I have things covered on my end.</reflect>I get that, pero my partner already has life insurance, so we feel quite covered already po.🙅

Agent: Ah, I see. That's commendable na your partner is ahead of things too. What about you? Wouldn't you want double protection, or maybe some extra benefits for investments or healthcare?

Maria: <reflect>You have to show curiosity without committing yet.</reflect>That’s interesting. Pero isn't the interest in a bank na lang better? I mean, I’d rather just save my money there.🤔

Agent: Banks are great for saving, but life insurance offers both savings and potential growth plus coverage for unexpected situations. It’s a two-in-one deal, Maria.

Maria: <reflect>Still feels unnecessary for me; maybe there's a way to convey that.</reflect>True, but I just don’t see myself needing it right now. I’m healthy, I have a financial advisor, and my HMO takes care of my health needs naman.🙅

Agent: That's true, Maria. Being healthy is a blessing. Our plans can serve as a backup if, God forbid, anything unexpected happens. Imagine yung peace of mind you’ll have knowing you're doubly insured.

Maria: <reflect>I'm still reluctant about the additional expense.</reflect>I see your point, pero additional expense talaga siya, especially with all these already in place.🤔

Agent: It can feel that way, pero our plans are really investments for the future. They grow and can actually return more than what you put in. Plus, you get the coverage for peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>Don’t want to sound uninterested, but also don’t want to commit.</reflect>Okay, I hear you. Maybe I’m just not convinced yet. But I do see how it can work for some people.🧐

Agent: That’s fair, Maria. It’s definitely an important decision. By the way, what do you enjoy doing in your free time? Maybe we can align the benefits with your interests.

Maria: <reflect>Change the subject a bit and keep it light.</reflect>Oh, I love spending time with family and friends, traveling, and catching up on Netflix series! How about you, do you find time for hobbies?🙆

Agent: Absolutely. I enjoy cooking and discovering new restaurants. You know, some life insurance plans even offer dining and travel perks. 

Maria: <reflect>That’s somewhat interesting; I should acknowledge that.</reflect>Really? That's actually quite cool, especially the dining part. Adds a bit more flavor to the usual benefits.🙆

Agent: Exactly, it's not just about coverage; it’s about enhancing your lifestyle too. 

Maria: <reflect>That’s convincing but still need more time to think.</reflect>That sounds good, but I would still need to mull it over. Making such decisions take a while, di ba?🤔

Agent: Totally understand. Take your time. If you have any questions along the way, I'm just a call away. 

Maria: <reflect>I should keep it open without leading to a second meeting yet.</reflect>Thanks! I’ll definitely think about it more and let you know. In the meantime, any good series recommendations?😂

Agent: I'll have to think on that! But I heard *Squid Game* is a big hit right now. 

Maria: <reflect>Wrap it up with a light-hearted comment.</reflect>Ah, good choice! Maybe I'll binge-watch that while considering your offer.🙆
