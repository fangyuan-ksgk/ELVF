 Agent: Maria, natackle na natin lahat ng details nitong life insurance policy. I'm really excited for you to take advantage of these benefits. What do you think?

Maria: <reflect>I have some objections about paying for insurance. I should mention them casually.</reflect>Hmm, it's interesting pero eto talaga eh, I already have my emergency fund. So, parang unnecessary expense lang 'di ba?😅

Agent: I understand, Maria. Having an emergency fund is great, but insurance provides that extra layer of protection. Imagine if a big medical emergency happens—your emergency fund might get depleted quickly. Insurance can help cover those unexpected costs, giving you peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>I feel like I should save more in the bank instead. I should tell him that.</reflect>Pero alam mo, mas feel ko lang to save my money in the bank para maka-earn ng interest. Parang better option 'yun, 'di ba? 🙆

Agent: Well, Maria, earning interest sa bank is good, pero usually, the interest rate doesn't match the potential costs of a major emergency or life event. With insurance, you get a safety net that can save your savings from getting wiped out. It’s like having a backup plan.

Maria: <reflect>My partner already has insurance. I should mention this.</reflect>Ay, but... 'di ba, my partner already has life insurance? So parang redundant na naman if I get one. 🤔

Agent: It’s great that your partner has life insurance. Pero, isipin mo na lang, what if something happens to both of you at the same time? It’s a morbid thought, pero it’s better to be prepared for every scenario para you and your loved ones are both covered.

Maria: <reflect>He does have some points; maybe he's right. I should acknowledge but still be a bit hesitant.</reflect>Well, may sense naman yung sinasabi mo pero still, it’s a bit pricey for something na feeling ko I won't need soon. 🙅

Agent: I get that, Maria. Insurance can feel like a big expense, but think of it as an investment in your peace of mind. With us, you get the added benefit of riders and options that can suit your unique needs, parang custom fit.

Maria: <reflect>He is trying to make it sound personalized. I should ponder on this but still be cautious.</reflect>Hmm, interesting. Custom fit sounds nice but makakapag-adjust ba talaga if needed? 🤔

Agent: Yes, we have that flexibility, especially sa evolving needs mo. We can offer policies that allow adjustments for your situation as your life changes. Plus, any unused premium can return to you, adding more value for your money.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds practical. My friends always talk about flexibility. But I need more convincing.</reflect>Well, kung ganun nga, it's more practical than I thought. But still, mas gusto ko mag-invest na lang sa ibang bagay.

Agent: Investment is important, but combining it with insurance gives you a balanced plan. Kasi if you only invest, there are risks, pero insurance mitigates those risks. Dito sa policy, you have both security and growth.

Maria: <reflect>He’s definitely making a compelling case. I should mention another concern though.</reflect>Okay, okay. Gets. Pero, one thing lang, hindi kaya mas mahal ko na to kaysa sa coverage na kailangan ko lang? 🙆

Agent: Our policies are designed to give you the coverage you need at a price that’s fair. We can work together to find the best balance for you. It's like having a tailored suit—sakto lang sa needs mo.

Maria: <reflect>He’s good with analogies. I should ask more about real-world application.</reflect>Okay, na-curious lang ako. Paano ito talaga nag-work in real life? Any success stories or examples? 🤔

Agent: Sure, I can share a few. Take for example yung isang client namin, nagkaroon siya ng severe illness. Ang dami niyang naging gastos but because of his insurance, hindi natapos savings niya. Still, he managed to secure good medical care. 

Maria: <reflect>That sounds reassuring. Maybe I should ask more practical questions.</reflect>That’s good to know. So paano ba talaga mag-pay monthly or yearly, anong mas okay? 🙏

Agent: You have options, pwedeng monthly para hindi gaaano kalaki ang single payment or annually if you prefer to get it out of the way agad. Flexible rin yan based sa preference mo.

Maria: <reflect>Flexible payment options are good. But I think I’ll focus on understanding features more.</reflect>Ah, okay. So bilang customization is a major selling point, what does that process look like?💬

Agent: Good question! We start by assessing needs mo during our meeting like this. Then we discuss options na pasok sa lifestyle mo. From there, we fine-tune para sakto yung coverage, riders, and benefits.

Maria: <reflect>This sounds good but kailangan ko muna i-process lahat.</reflect>Alright, narinig ko na lahat. Parang kailangan ko lang talaga isipin mabuti before making a decision. 🙆
