 Agent: Hi Maria, kamusta? Finally nice to meet you after all our messages. So what do you think about the product details we discussed so far?

Maria: <reflect>He wants to know my thoughts, I should raise my concerns first.</reflect>Hi Alex! Nice to finally meet you too. You know, I find everything you said quite interesting, but I think now is not a perfect time for me. Parang hindi siya urgent for me right now because Iâ€™m still young and healthy.ðŸ™…

Agent: I totally understand where you're coming from, Maria. Life insurance might feel unnecessary now because you are young and healthy. But the thing is, starting a policy while youâ€™re at your healthiest makes it more affordable, and it guarantees your coverage when you might need it in the future.

Maria: <reflect>He has a point, but I still have another concern.</reflect>I guess that makes sense. But honestly, I don't see the immediate need since I'm not married and I don't have kids pa naman. I don't feel the pressure to get insured. ðŸ™…

Agent: Thatâ€™s very common, Maria. Many people think life insurance is just for those with dependents. However, itâ€™s also a way to prepare and secure your future regardless of your current status. It can also provide a financial safety net for any unforeseen events that might come your way.

Maria: <reflect>He's giving valid reasons, but I still have doubts.</reflect>Okay, thatâ€™s something to consider. But right now, I'm not really supporting anyone with my income. So, I'm struggling to see why I should prioritize insurance. ðŸ™…

Agent: I appreciate your honesty, Maria. Insurance is not just for supporting others; it also helps protect you and your future financial plans. Think of it as a way to save and grow your money over time while having peace of mind.

Maria: <reflect>He's making it sound more practical, I should think of a follow-up question about the product.</reflect>Hmm, you have a good point there. So, nabanggit mo yung pag-grow ng pera over time. How does that work? ðŸ™†

Agent: Great question, Maria. We have policies that have an investment component. This means a part of your premium goes into an investment fund, potentially giving you returns over time. Itâ€™s like hitting two birds with one stone - protection and savings.

Maria: <reflect>Thatâ€™s interesting; heâ€™s really trying to make it appealing.</reflect>Okay, that does sound appealing. But how flexible is it? Like, can I adjust my policy later on if I need to? ðŸ™†

Agent: Yes, we have flexible plans that allow adjustments based on your life changes. You can upgrade or even downgrade your coverage and benefits when needed. Weâ€™re here to make sure your policy fits your life at any stage.

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility is a good thing; I should ask about costs next.</reflect>Flexibility is nice to hear. So, how much would something like this cost? Iâ€™m a bit worried about the premiums being too expensive for my budget. ðŸ™†

Agent: Thatâ€™s a valid concern, Maria. Our plans are quite customizable, so you can choose one that fits within your budget. I can assure you that we offer very competitive rates without compromising the coverage and benefits.

Maria: <reflect>He seems confident about the affordability, letâ€™s see more details.</reflect>Alright, I might consider it then. Could you walk me through a sample plan based on someone my age and situation? ðŸ™†

Agent: Sure! For someone like you, young and healthy, a basic plan can start as low as around PHP 1,500 a month. This includes coverage for critical illnesses, accident protection, and a cash benefit to your beneficiaries.

Maria: <reflect>He gave a lot of information there; I need to ask more.</reflect>PHP 1,500 a month sounds manageable. But what if I want to stop the policy at some point? ðŸ™†

Agent: Good question, Maria. Most of our plans have a surrender value, meaning if you decide to stop your policy after a certain period, you can get back a portion of the premiums paid. Itâ€™s like a safety net for you as well.

Maria: <reflect>That's reassuring; maybe it's not as risky as I thought.</reflect>Alright, that sounds fair naman. Last question, Alex, what sets FWD apart from other insurance companies in the market? ðŸ™†

Agent: Excellent question, Maria! FWD is unique because we focus heavily on customer experience and innovative, flexible products. We aim to simplify the insurance process and make it relatable and beneficial to our clients.

Maria: <reflect>He seems convinced about his company.</reflect>Well, I appreciate you explaining everything, Alex. This was really helpful. ðŸ™†
