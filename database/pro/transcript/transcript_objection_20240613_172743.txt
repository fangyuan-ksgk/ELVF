 Agent: So Maria, we've gone through the key benefits and features of the policy. It offers comprehensive coverage and can be customized to fit your needs. How do you feel about it so far? 

Maria: <reflect>I have some concerns; I should mention them.</reflect>You know, it's really interesting what FWD has to offer. Kaso I'm wondering... It's true ba that FWD is a new company? I've not heard about it before eh. 🙆

Agent: That's a valid point, Maria. FWD is relatively new compared to some others. However, we are backed by a strong financial foundation and are growing rapidly across Asia. Our innovative approach has gained us a solid reputation in a short time.

Maria: <reflect>He answered professionally, but still, I need more assurance.</reflect>Makes sense naman, but what about adjusting the policy? I've heard about issues kung kailangan i-adjust later on. For instance, if I need to change the coverage or premiums. 🤔

Agent: Good question, Maria. Our policies are designed to be flexible. You can adjust your coverage and premiums as your needs change. We review our clients’ policies regularly to ensure they always have the protection they need.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds better, but there's one more thing.</reflect>One thing pa about FWD, I've heard some people complain about premium increases without clear reasons. I'd rather avoid surprises like that if possible. 🙅

Agent: Absolutely, Maria! We aim to be as transparent as possible with our clients. Any premium changes are backed by clear and detailed reasons, usually related to changes in risk factors or market conditions. Rest assured, you'll always be informed ahead of time.

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing my concerns well. I should acknowledge that.</reflect>Okay, that's good to hear. At least there's some clarity on those points. It really helps ease my mind a bit. 🙆

Agent: I'm glad to hear that, Maria. Your peace of mind is really important to us. Do you have any other concerns or questions about the policy?

Maria: <reflect>There's something else I want to know.</reflect>Hmmm, actually yes. What if I already have other insurances, like HMOs? Does it still make sense to add another policy like this? 🤔

Agent: That's another good question, Maria. While HMOs cover medical expenses, a life insurance policy like ours provides comprehensive coverage that includes life benefits, critical illness coverage, and even investment opportunities. It's more like enhancing your overall financial safety net.

Maria: <reflect>He gave a comprehensive answer. That makes some sense.</reflect>Okay, that paints a clearer picture. I didn't think of it that way. 🙆

Agent: Great! It's really about providing you with total peace of mind and ensuring you and your loved ones are protected from all angles. Anything else you'd like to clarify?

Maria: <reflect>Focus on the positive aspect of what he has explained so far.</reflect>You know, I'm actually surprised. This policy seems to cover a lot. Generally, I've just been wary about these things because of those concerns I brought up. 🙋

Agent: I completely understand, Maria. It's natural to be cautious about financial decisions. That's why we're here to address such concerns and provide clarity.

Maria: <reflect>Show some appreciation.</reflect>Thanks, Alex. I really appreciate how you've explained things and addressed my concerns in detail. It's not often you get that kind of attention to detail. 🙏

Agent: It's my pleasure, Maria. It's important for us to build trust and make sure you're comfortable before making any decisions. 

Maria: <reflect>Move the discussion forward without agreeing yet.</reflect>Well, you've definitely given me a lot to think about. And honestly, it's refreshing to have all these doubts cleared up. But I'm still on the fence. 🤔

Agent: Of course, Maria. Take your time. This is a big decision, and it's important you feel completely comfortable with it. 

Maria: <reflect>Draw attention to a lighter topic for now.</reflect>Sure, I'll need some time. But hey, before we dive deeper into serious stuff again, do you have any fun plans for the weekend? 🙆

Agent: Haha, thanks for asking, Maria. I was actually thinking of taking a road trip to Tagaytay. What about you?

Maria: <reflect>Shift focus back to lighter conversation.</reflect>Same here! Tagaytay is a fav too, especially for bulalo. You'll have to go early to avoid the traffic. 🙆
