 Agent: So, Maria, you seemed quite interested in the product features earlier. What do you think about the benefits weâ€™ve talked about?

Maria: <reflect>He's really convinced about this product, but I have some reservations.</reflect>Honestly, Alex, I get why insurance can be important, but isnâ€™t it better to save the money in the bank to earn interest?ðŸ¤”

Agent: Thatâ€™s a common thought, Maria. Itâ€™s true that saving money in the bank can earn interest, but let me ask you this: do you think the interest will be enough to cover unexpected medical emergencies or provide for your loved ones if something happens to you?

Maria: <reflect>He has a point, but I still have my doubts.</reflect>Well, I see your point, pero my partner already has life insurance. Parang I don't see the need to have another one.ðŸ¤”

Agent: Thatâ€™s understandable, Maria. However, having your own policy can give you direct control and additional security. Plus, it ensures that you have an extra layer of protection without solely relying on your partner's coverage.

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing my concerns well, pero I still have another one.</reflect>But then, I have assets din naman. Why should I spend on an insurance policy when I have investments and properties?ðŸ¤·

Agent: Great question, Maria. While assets and properties are valuable, they arenâ€™t always liquid. Imagine if an emergency happens â€“ you might not be able to sell those assets right away. Insurance ensures that you have immediate funds when you need them the most.

Maria: <reflect>He's very convincing, and his arguments make sense.</reflect>I get what you mean. But still, I don't like the idea of overpaying for coverage I don't need.

Agent: Totally understandable, Maria. The good thing about our plan is that it is customizable. You can choose the coverage that fits your needs and budget. We can ensure youâ€™re only paying for what you genuinely need.

Maria: <reflect>He's good at addressing objections, and he's quite persistent.</reflect>Hmm, customizable sounds a bit more reasonable. But donâ€™t you think insurance can be an unnecessary expense?

Agent: I get that point, Maria. Think of it this way though: insurance is like having an emergency fund but with added benefits. It gives you peace of mind, knowing that youâ€™re financially prepared for life's uncertainties.

Maria: <reflect>He's making a lot of sense, but it's a big decision.</reflect>You know, Alex, all this information is just a lot to take in. Parang I have to think about it more.

Agent: Of course, Maria. Itâ€™s a big decision, and I completely understand that. Take your time to think it over. If you have any more questions or need clarification, you can always reach out to me.

Maria: <reflect>Heâ€™s being understanding, which is nice. Maybe I should ask something practical.</reflect>Okay, thanks Alex. By the way, what happens if I suddenly can't pay the premium one month?ðŸ¤”

Agent: Thatâ€™s a valuable question, Maria. Most policies have a grace period, usually about 30 days. If you canâ€™t pay within that period, you can work with your advisor to find a solution, like adjusting the payment schedule.

Maria: <reflect>Thatâ€™s fair enough. He did address my worry about premium payments.</reflect>Got it. That sounds reassuring at least. Another thing, is it true that insurance claims can be a hassle?

Agent: I understand where youâ€™re coming from, Maria. But with FWD, we ensure the claims process is straightforward and hassle-free. We guide our clients every step of the way to make it as smooth as possible.

Maria: <reflect>So far, everything seems well thought out on their end.</reflect>Well, I appreciate the information, Alex. To think na I was so set against insurance before. Youâ€™ve given me a lot to consider.

Agent: Happy to be of service, Maria. Itâ€™s always good to arm yourself with information. If you have any more questions, kahit on a different day, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me.

Maria: <reflect>He's really trying to ensure I'm comfortable with the decision. Itâ€™s nice.</reflect>Thanks, Alex. I might take you up on that. For now, Iâ€™ll definitely mull over all this info.

Agent: Perfectly fine, Maria. It's important to make an informed decision. By the way, if there's one more thing youâ€™d like to know about our policies, what would it be?
