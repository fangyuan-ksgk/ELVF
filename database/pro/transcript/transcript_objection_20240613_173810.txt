 Agent: So, Maria, those are the main benefits of our new life insurance policy from FWD. How do you feel about it so far?

Maria: <reflect>Sige, I have to address some of my reservations para clear lahat.</reflect> Thanks for explaining, Alex. But you know, I usually prefer to do my research first. I'm not easily convinced, especially when it comes to big decisions like these.🤔

Agent: I totally understand, Maria. It's really important to make an informed decision. We actually have a lot of resources online and customer testimonials that you can check out to help you with your research. Have you had a chance to look at any insurance products before? 

Maria: <reflect>Sabi nya merong resources, pero baka may kailangan pang i-explain for context</reflect> Yes, but to be honest, I can find better insurance elsewhere. There's so many options out there, and madalas mas mababa ang premiums sa iba. 🙅

Agent: I hear you. The market is indeed full of options. What sets us apart at FWD is not just the price but also the comprehensive coverage and personalized service we offer. We strive to ensure that our clients are well taken care of, not just with the policy but also with the support they need. Does that sound like something that might interest you? 

Maria: <reflect>Ok, sounds good, pero I still have some trust issues buying from someone new.</reflect>Well, to be honest, if I were to buy insurance, I'd rather buy from someone I know. Diba, there's more peace of mind knowing someone personally.🤔

Agent: That's definitely valid, Maria. Recognizing trust is so important. We actually encourage our clients to get to know us better. Many of our customers start as referrals from family and friends. In fact, feel free to talk to people who have worked with us before, so you can hear about their experiences firsthand. Has anyone close to you ever recommended an insurance provider?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to assure me through testimonials and referrals. Maybe there's some truth to that.</reflect>I haven't really asked around too much, pero maybe I should. You think anyone close to me might know about FWD?

Agent: It's very likely! We've been quite active in the community, so perhaps a colleague, a friend, or even a family member might know about us. In the meantime, if there are any other concerns or questions you have about our policies, feel free to ask. 

Maria: <reflect>He's still addressing my doubts, but I should voice another concern.</reflect>Well, Alex, I’m also thinking about how this might impact my budget. I’ve heard na insurance premiums can be quite expensive. Living in Manila isn’t cheap after all. 🙅

Agent: It's true that premiums can add up, Maria, but we offer various plans that cater to different budgets. We also have flexible payment options to make them more manageable. Sometimes, it's about finding the right balance between cost and the coverage you need. Would knowing more about these flexible options make you more comfortable?

Maria: <reflect>Seems like he has thought this through. Maybe I should ask about flexibility for better perspective.</reflect>Sige, tell me about these flexible payment options. How flexible are we talking about here? 🙏

Agent: We offer monthly, quarterly, or yearly payment plans, depending on what suits you best. Plus, we can tailor-make a plan that fits your financial situation. This way, you can still have peace of mind without straining your budget. What's usually easier for you—monthly or quarterly payments?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to make it easy for me, I appreciate that. I should also see how others benefit before I decide.</reflect>Hmmm, siguro monthly would be easier. But I think it would help kung I hear more about real-life client experiences. Any stories that stand out to you?

Agent: Absolutely! One of our clients recently shared how our policy helped his family during a critical time. He was skeptical at first, but now he's relieved he made that choice. We even have some testimonials on our website. Would you like to hear more detailed stories over coffee one of these days, or should I share a few now? 

Maria: <reflect>Stories might make this feel more relatable. Maybe hearing one might give a clearer picture.</reflect>Sure, tell me about one of those stories. It's always better to hear specifics, so I can imagine myself in their shoes.🙆

Agent: Okay, here's a good one. One of our policyholders was a single mom who wanted to ensure her child's future was secured. She started with a basic plan, and over the years, she was able to adjust and upgrade as her finances improved. When she encountered a health issue, our policy covered her medical expenses, ensuring she didn’t have to dip into her savings. This allowed her to focus on recovery while ensuring her child’s future was still secure.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds really reassuring. Maybe I need to think about this more deeply for my own family</reflect>Wow, that's really touching. It’s good to know that it can actually make that big of a difference. But honestly, how often do you hear stories like that?🤔

Agent: Quite often, actually. Many of our clients share similar sentiments, and each story reinforces our commitment to providing the best possible service. Our goal is to ensure every client feels valued and supported. Perhaps you’d like to hear more in detail? Maybe over a casual coffee chat another day?

Maria: <reflect>He’s persistent, but in a good way. Maybe I should consider meeting again to dive deeper.</reflect>That sounds nice. I guess it wouldn't hurt to hear a bit more. Although, I’ll need to process all this info first.🙏
