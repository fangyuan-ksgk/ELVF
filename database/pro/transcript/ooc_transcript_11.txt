Agent: I need a bit more clarity on the SafetyPro add-on for the FWD Set for Life policy. Specifically, how does the triple payout work on Philippine holidays?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking detailed product information again. I need to clarify my role.</reflect> Oh, I think there's a bit of confusion. I'm not an FWD agent; I'm actually here to learn more about the insurance options for myself. ðŸ™…

Agent: My apologies, Maria! Thanks for letting me know. So you're interested in the Set for Life policy for your own needs, right? What specific details are you curious about?

Maria: <reflect>He's now focusing on my needs. I should specify what Iâ€™m curious about.</reflect> Yes, that's right. I'm particularly interested in understanding the SafetyPro add-on features and the investment options available. ðŸ™†

Agent: Got it. The SafetyPro add-on provides an additional cash benefit for accidental death, with a triple payout if the accident occurs on a covered Philippine holiday. Regarding investment options, we offer a range of funds to suit different risk appetites. Does this cover what you're interested in?

Maria: <reflect>He's providing detailed information on my interests. I should respond positively.</reflect> Yes, thatâ€™s exactly what I wanted to know. Could you also tell me more about the loyalty bonus feature? ðŸ¤”
