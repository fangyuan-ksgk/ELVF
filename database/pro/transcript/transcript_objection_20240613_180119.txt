 Agent: So as we've discussed the product details, I'm really curious, what do you think? 

Maria: <reflect>I'll bring up the issue of cost since that's a concern for me.</reflect>You know, the product sounds amazing, but I'm worried about the costs. ðŸ™…

Agent: I understand. Many people feel the same way. Actually, whatâ€™s great about this policy is that it's quite affordable. We can customize the premium payments to fit your budget. 

Maria: <reflect>Sounds flexible, but I'm still concerned about my budget.</reflect>Hmm, even if it's flexible, I still have my doubts. My salary is just enough to cover my expenses. ðŸ¤”

Agent: It makes sense to be cautious, but think about it this way: having insurance can actually lift a huge financial burden in times of need. Hindi 'di ba it's better to be prepared than to be caught off guard?

Maria: <reflect>True, but I have other financial priorities like loans to pay off.</reflect>Well, right now, I'm still paying off my loans, so no extra money for premiums. ðŸ™…

Agent: Loans can be quite tough, I get that. But, having insurance can actually help protect your financial stability while paying off those loans. It's like having a safety net. 

Maria: <reflect>Interesting point, but saving money seems more beneficial to me right now.</reflect>I think saving money is more important for me at this point. ðŸ’¬

Agent: Saving money is indeed important. However, the beauty of having insurance is that it acts as an emergency fund specifically for health and life contingencies, allowing your savings to remain untouched.

Maria: <reflect>Still not convinced, let me express one of the larger objections.</reflect>I just think it's an unnecessary expense right now when I have a tight budget. ðŸ˜…

Agent: I get what you mean. But imagine, with insurance, you're not juggling between emergency expenses and your regular bills. It's peace of mind without affecting your daily budget.

Maria: <reflect>I need to dig deeper into understanding if it's a priority.</reflect>So, you're saying itâ€™s more like a backup? What if I think Iâ€™m already saving enough? ðŸ¤”

Agent: Yes, exactly. Itâ€™s like a backup you hopefully won't need, but itâ€™s there just in case. And in case of a major incident, your savings might not be enough to cover large expenses, which is where insurance steps in. 

Maria: <reflect>Ok, that makes sense. But the big issue is still the premium and my income limitations.</reflect>Still, the premium is a big concern. My income isnâ€™t that much to spare for insurance too. ðŸ˜…

Agent: That's a common scenario for many, but letâ€™s focus on what you can afford. We offer plans where you can start with small premiums and adjust them as your financial situation improves.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, I could probably consider that. But what if I lose my job or my income goes down?</reflect>But what if I suddenly lose my job or my income decreases? ðŸ’¬

Agent: That's a valid concern. Our policies have built-in features and flexible payment options, including grace periods that can help you keep the policy active during tough times.

Maria: <reflect>He has an answer for everything, this is interesting.</reflect>Okay, that's something I didnâ€™t know. Sounds helpful. ðŸ™†

Agent: It really is. Remember, insurance is about long-term stability and safeguarding your future. So, having it is like a financial safety net for you and your loved ones.

Maria: <reflect>Maybe I should take it more seriously but still consider my budget.</reflect>Alright, itâ€™s making more sense now. I'll just have to carefully consider how it fits into my budget. ðŸ¤”

Agent: Absolutely, and I'm here to help you find the right balance between affordability and adequate coverage. We can work together to create a plan that suits your needs and budget.

Maria: <reflect>He's really helpful and approachable. This isn't so bad after all.</reflect>Thanks for being so helpful. I'll definitely think more about it. ðŸ™†
