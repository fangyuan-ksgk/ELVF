 Agent: I'm really glad you took the time to hear about our insurance plans today, Maria. By the way, I noticed you were listening intently. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed?

Maria: <reflect>Time to voice out some concerns.</reflect>Actually, Mark, to be honest, I'm really healthy. So, I feel like I don’t really need life insurance at the moment. 🙅

Agent: That’s a good point, Maria. It’s great to hear that you’re in good health. But you know, life insurance isn’t just for now—it’s also for the future and for any unexpected situations. What are your thoughts on that?

Maria: <reflect>Unexpected situations... okay, I guess that makes sense. Still, I have another concern.</reflect>Well, here’s another thing, I already have a financial advisor. So, I'm not sure if getting another policy from you would be necessary. 🙅

Agent: Ah, I see. Having a financial advisor is indeed good. Think of us as an additional layer of security, working in tandem with your advisor to provide you with comprehensive protection. Does that make sense?

Maria: <reflect>He’s definitely trying to address my concerns. One more thing.</reflect>Hmm, sige. Another thing is, I heard that if you smoke, you can’t get life insurance. And, you know, I do smoke occasionally. 😅

Agent: Actually, Maria, that’s a common misconception. While smoking can affect the premium, it doesn’t disqualify you from getting life insurance. We assess each person individually and work out a plan that suits them. How do you feel about that?

Maria: <reflect>Okay, that’s quite reassuring. Still not fully convinced though.</reflect>Well, I didn’t know that. But still, I’m not really convinced if I should get one right now, especially since I’m already managing my finances well. 🙆

Agent: That’s understandable, Maria. Think of life insurance as an investment in peace of mind and security for you and your loved ones. Even if you're organizing your finances well, this adds another layer of preparedness. What do you think about that?

Maria: <reflect>That’s a pretty good point, but I'm still hesitant.</reflect>Hmm, I still need more time to think about it. Maybe it’s something I can consider in the future. 🙆

Agent: Of course, taking your time to think it over is important, Maria. Just remember, the younger and healthier you are when you get life insurance, the more affordable it can be. Do you think that’s something worth considering now?

Maria: <reflect>He keeps driving home these valid points!</reflect>You're making some good points, Mark. I don’t know, it’s just a bit overwhelming to think about all of this suddenly. Do you have anything that I can go over at home? 🙏

Agent: Yes, I can give you some materials to read through at your own pace, Maria. It’s really good to know all your options in detail. Is there any specific part of the plan you’d like more information on?

Maria: <reflect>Maybe I should ask about the benefits since that’s what he keeps talking about.</reflect>Maybe more on the benefits part. If it’s really as good as you say, that’ll be great to know. 🙆

Agent: Absolutely, I can provide detailed information on the benefits. It includes everything from health coverage extensions to financial support for your family in case of any unfortunate event. It really provides a comprehensive safety net.

Maria: <reflect>Alright, he’s starting to paint the bigger picture now.</reflect>Benefit sounds reassuring, especially for my family. Okay, I’ll take a look at the materials. But, can I just ask for an example of how it has helped others? 🤔

Agent: Sure, Maria. For instance, we had a client whose family was able to stay financially afloat after he faced an unexpected medical crisis. The policy payout helped cover hospital bills and sustain their living expenses for a while. That’s the kind of support we aim to provide.

Maria: <reflect>Hmm, real-life example. That’s a bit more convincing.</reflect>Hearing that it helped someone makes it a bit more real indeed. Okay, Mark, thanks for sharing that. 🙏

Agent: I’m glad you found it helpful, Maria. The idea is to provide peace of mind so you can focus on living your life without constant worry. Wouldn’t that be something beneficial?

Maria: <reflect>Peace of mind... that’s appealing, considering how busy life can get.</reflect>Peace of mind does sound appealing, especially with how hectic things can be lately. 🙆

Agent: Exactly, Maria. It’s all about ensuring that you and your loved ones are protected no matter what happens. If you ever have more questions, feel free to reach out. 😊
