 Agent: Maria, it's great to chat more with you! Let's dive into this a bit. Can you tell me more about your financial goals and aspirations? What are the big dreams that keep you motivated?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking about my finances and goals; I should mention something general first.</reflect>Oh wow, that's a big question, di ba? Well, I guess, like many Filipinos, I want to ensure my family is secure, especially sa future. And of course, sana maka-bakasyon abroad regularly! 😂🙆

Agent: Those are fantastic goals! Securing your family's future is very important. How about your current financial setup? Do you have any savings or investments already in place?

Maria: <reflect>Looks like he’s digging deeper; I’ll keep it light but honest.</reflect>Yes naman, I'm trying my best. May konting savings and a few small investments here and there. Pero siyempre, I feel like baka kulang pa rin. 🤔

Agent: That's a great start, Maria. Every little bit helps, you know? So, are you familiar with any insurance products that can complement your savings and investments?

Maria: <reflect>Time to admit I need more info. This could guide the convo.</reflect>Hmm, I have some basic insurance, pero I think I need more understanding about how it can complement what I already have. 🙏

Agent: That's exactly where we can help. At FWD, we have comprehensive plans that not only secure your present but also cater to your future financial goals. Interested to hear more about how these plans can benefit you?

Maria: <reflect>He’s offering more info about their product; I should show some interest.</reflect>Ay, yes, that would be great! Always open to learning more, lalo na if it can help me secure my family's future. 💬

Agent: That's the spirit, Maria! So, we have this plan that provides life insurance and also works as an investment. It's like hitting two birds with one stone. How does that sound?

Maria: <reflect>Wow, that sounds useful but also complicated; I’ll ask for details.</reflect>Hmm, parang interesting! But can you explain how it works more simply? I'm not so good with complex things. 😂🙆

Agent: Absolutely! It’s actually pretty straightforward. Part of your premium goes to your life coverage, while the other part is invested in various funds that can grow over time. Simple, di ba?

Maria: <reflect>I like the simplicity; let's see how else I can benefit.</reflect>Got it. Simple nga. So, paano ako magbe-benefit dito in the long run? 👍

Agent: Over the long term, not only do you get the security of life insurance, but your funds can grow, which you can use for future expenses like education or even your dream vacations abroad!

Maria: <reflect>Dream vacations! Sounds enticing. I should ask more about the growth part.</reflect>Nice yan, ha! Pero, paano naman nag-grow yung funds? Do I need to do anything? 🙆

Agent: Great question, Maria! You don’t need to do anything extra. Our experts manage the investments for you. All you need to do is regularly pay your premiums. We take care of the rest.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, no extra work; this sounds good. Need to clarify the commitment needed.</reflect>Ah, I see! So, ilang years ba ako kailangan mag-commit dito? 🤔

Agent: You can choose the term, so it’s flexible. Some plans can be as short as 5 years, while others go up to 20 or even more. It all depends on your goals and what suits you best.

Maria: <reflect>Flexibility is nice to hear. I'll ask about making changes to the plan.</reflect>Flexible, I like that. So, paano kung may changes akong gustong gawin? Can I adjust the plan along the way? 💬

Agent: Definitely! Our plans are designed to adapt to your changing needs. You can make adjustments to your coverage and investments as your situation evolves over time.

Maria: <reflect>This sounds convenient. I should ask about the costs involved next.</reflect>Okay, that’s very convenient. So, how much will this cost me? 😆

Agent: It varies depending on the coverage amount and the term you choose. But don't worry, we can design a plan that suits your budget. Want to see some sample computations?

Maria: <reflect>Sample computations sound good; I should agree to this next step.</reflect>Sure, I'd love to see some samples. It might help me understand better. 🙆

Agent: Perfect! I'll prepare some examples for you. While I do that, any specific goals you want to target? Like, are you thinking more about education, retirement, or that dream Europe trip?

Maria: <reflect>I should give a realistic goal to help him with the examples.</reflect>I think focusing on education for now would be great. And let's not forget that Europe trip! 😆🙆
