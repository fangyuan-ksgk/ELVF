 Agent: So Maria, what do you think about our insurance policy? 

Maria: <reflect>I want to address my concerns about money. I should bring that up first.</reflect>The policy sounds good, but honestly, saving money is more important for me right now. I have a tight budget, especially with all my other expenses. 🙏

Agent: I totally understand that, Maria. Balancing finances can be really tough. But have you considered that a life insurance policy could actually help you save more in the long run by covering unexpected expenses?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to shift my mindset. I need to bring up another concern.</reflect>Pero, insurance isn't really a priority for my budget. Fixed expenses lang are already a lot for me. 🙅

Agent: I get it completely. But think of it this way, investing in a policy now can alleviate future burdens. We have flexible payment options that might fit your budget better.

Maria: <reflect>Flexible payment options? I should point out another aspect that worries me.</reflect>I heard that the premiums are usually expensive. I'd rather use that money to cover my monthly bills. 🤔

Agent: That's a common concern, Maria. But we have very affordable options, tailored to different financial situations. We can find something that won’t strain your finances.

Maria: <reflect>He's really trying to convince me about affordability. I should mention my limited income.</reflect>The thing is, my salary is not that high. I don't want to overcommit to something I can't sustain. 🤔

Agent: That makes sense. But even small contributions can provide significant coverage and peace of mind. Plus, starting small means you can always adjust as your financial situation improves.

Maria: <reflect>He keeps bringing it back to the benefits. I should be honest about my current spending priorities.</reflect>I see where you're coming from. But between rent and other essentials, there's just no room left in my budget. 😢

Agent: Living expenses can definitely eat up most of our income. But what about considering a policy which gives you back a portion of your premiums? It’s like saving while you’re protecting yourself.

Maria: <reflect>Interesting offer, but I need to bring up my other financial responsibilities.</reflect>I am still paying off a loan, you know. Taking on additional financial commitments seems risky for me right now. 🙅

Agent: Ah, that's a significant concern. But imagine if something unexpected happened, those loan payments might be even harder to manage without coverage. A policy can actually work in your favor. 

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to show the protective side of insurance. Maybe I should ask a different question to understand better.</reflect>Okay, let's say I consider a policy. What's the minimum coverage I can start with? 🤔

Agent: Great question, Maria! We have plans that start with very minimal coverage which won't heavily impact your budget. It’s more about having something rather than nothing at all. 

Maria: <reflect>He's making it sound more doable. I should clarify the payment options again.</reflect>Do you offer monthly payment plans? I think that would be easier for me to manage.👍

Agent: Absolutely! Monthly payment plans are available and very popular. It helps in spreading the cost throughout the year so it’s less of a burden.

Maria: <reflect>This might not be too bad, but I still need assurance about flexibility.</reflect>If ever my financial situation changes, can I adjust my policy or discontinue it without huge penalties? 🙆

Agent: Yes, you can adjust your policy. We’re here to help you make the best decisions for your financial health, even if it means making changes.

Maria: <reflect>He's assuring me of flexibility. I feel a bit more at ease.</reflect>Alright, I’ll consider this. Can you share a few examples of the affordable plans you mentioned?🙏

Agent: Sure, let’s talk about our basic starter plan. It’s designed for people in situations similar to yours and it’s very affordable. Let me give you the details...

Maria: <reflect>Being specific helps in understanding better.</reflect>Alright, give me the rundown. This is getting interesting. 🤔
