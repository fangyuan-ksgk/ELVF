 Agent: I'm glad we were able to go through everything, Maria. You seem really interested in the policy. Do you have any other questions or concerns about it?

Maria: <reflect>There's a few things I need to address, especially about my budget.</reflect>Ano kasi, Alex, to be honest, I think the premium is too expensive for my budget. I mean, my salary is not enough to spend on insurance every month talaga. 🤔

Agent: I understand, Maria. Budgeting is really important. Pero you know, having insurance is like setting aside a small amount for a potential big need. Does your premium include health or investments? 

Maria: <reflect>He's making a good point, but I really have to prioritize my spending right now.</reflect>Oo nga, pero I still feel like it's not a priority in my budget. Ang dami ko pang bills na binabayaran, and I'm still paying off my loan, so hindi ko sure kung magiging feasible pa itong insurance. 🙅

Agent: That’s understandable, Maria. Pero with the flexible payment options we offer, pwede naman namin i-adjust yung premiums based on your budget. How about we look at a plan with a lower premium for you?

Maria: <reflect>He's suggesting a compromise but I still have concerns. I should explain more about my financial situation.</reflect>Significant talaga yung magiging out-of-pocket expenses ko kung mag-a-avail ako ng insurance ngayon, since no budget talaga. Na-curious lang ako, is this policy good for emergency funds? 🙆

Agent: You’re right, Maria. Insurance can be an effective way to build an emergency fund because it provides a safety net. Imagine, incase anything happens, you’re still financially protected!

Maria: <reflect>He mentioned a good point, but I also want to save more.</reflect>Better to save the money in the bank to earn interest, di ba? Nag-iipon kasi ako ng savings for emergencies. 

Agent: Saving in the bank is wise, Maria, but insurance offers financial protection that savings alone can't provide. For example, in case of unexpected illness or accident, savings might not be enough, especially with current medical expenses.

Maria: <reflect>That's a valid point. But still trying to manage my current finances.</reflect>Sana nga, pero right now, feeling ko unnecessary expense lang siya for me. I already have a strategy to cope with emergencies, kasi may assets na din ako.

Agent: I see your point, Maria. But consider this: insurance can actually complement your assets by providing liquid funds that you don’t have to liquidate your properties or investments for emergencies.

Maria: <reflect>He's making sense, but I'm still not sold on the idea completely.</reflect>Oo, nakakaintriga siya. Pero like I said, the salary is just not enough, lalo na may mga my other financial plans pa.

Agent: Naiintindihan ko, Maria. Kaya nga we offer customizable plans that we can tailor fit sa needs at budget mo. I could show you some options na mas affordable.

Maria: <reflect>I should hear him out on the more affordable options, if any.</reflect>Alright, let’s see nga kung ano yung mas fit sa budget ko. But honestly, save money is important for me. 🙏

Agent: Great point! We can put together a plan na talaga fits within your savings goal. May mga packages kami na very minimal premiums, pero same benefits pa din.

Maria: <reflect>It sounds interesting, and it's worth listening.</reflect>Talaga? Okay, I'll give it a try to listen to your options. Always better to explore diba? 🙆
