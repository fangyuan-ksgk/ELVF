Agent: So, Maria, how do you feel about what we've discussed so far? I'm curious to know your thoughts on the Set for Life policy. It's meant to offer both protection and investment for people with different financial goals, similar to yours. 

Maria: <reflect>I need more information on how this product actually fits my specific situation and concerns.</reflect>Well, I think it's interesting. Pero, parang nalito ako sa investment part. How does that work along with the life protection?🤔

Agent: Great question, Maria! The Set for Life policy offers a combination of life protection and investment. You get the life insurance coverage up to age 100, plus you can choose from various investment funds that suit your risk appetite. Essentially, habang covered ka, your money is also working for you. So, while you get life protection, you also have the chance to grow your savings.

Maria: <reflect>That makes it a bit clearer, but I still have concerns about fitting it into my budget and financial goals.</reflect>Okay, that makes more sense. But I guess my concern now is, how does this fit into my current budget and financial goals? I'm already saving for my kids' college funds, and I also want to make sure I can retire comfortably.😅

Agent: I totally understand that, Maria. One of the great things about the Set for Life policy is its flexibility. You can choose a payment period that suits your budget—whether it's 5 years, 10 years, or even up to age 99. Plus, there are several add-ons like HealthPro and SafetyPro that can provide additional benefits without breaking the bank.

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing the flexibility and add-ons, but I need more details on how these can help my long-term goals.</reflect>Hmm, interesting. So, aside from the flexibility in payments, how do those add-ons actually help me in the long run, like for my retirement and kids' education?🙆

Agent: Great that you asked! For your kids' education, having a policy like Set for Life ensures that even if something happens to you, they would get a lump sum amount that can help cover their educational expenses. For retirement, the loyalty bonuses and the account value that grows with your investments can serve as a supplementary fund. Plus, the Waiver of Premium means that if you suffer a major illness, you don't have to worry about paying premiums anymore.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds reassuring, but I’m still not entirely convinced about the investment aspect.</reflect>I guess that sounds comforting. But this investment part, how secure is that? I hear lots of horror stories about market fluctuations and all that.😬

Agent: Completely valid concern, Maria! The good news is we offer diverse investment funds ranging from conservative to aggressive. You can choose based on your comfort level. And don't forget, it's not all about the returns; you're also getting substantial life insurance coverage, which is a safety net in itself.

Maria: <reflect>He's making a solid point, but I should ask about the loyalty bonuses and how they actually work.</reflect>Okay, that does ease my mind a bit. Nakakatuwa naman. But these loyalty bonuses you mentioned, how do they work exactly? Is it guaranteed or parang merong ifs and buts?🤔

Agent: Good catch! The loyalty bonuses are indeed non-guaranteed and depend on certain conditions, like not making any withdrawals and ensuring the policy has not been reinstated. Every ten years, and then every five years after that, you can receive these bonuses, which comes in handy for extra savings.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds beneficial but I’m still thinking about those unforeseen expenses.</reflect>Oh, that's nice. You mentioned not making any withdrawals—what if there's an urgent need for cash? Like unexpected medical bills, for example?🙅

Agent: Absolutely, life is unpredictable. One of the perks of Set for Life is partial withdrawal. You can access a portion of your account value if you need it for emergencies, while still keeping your policy active. This way, you get flexibility without sacrificing your long-term goals.

Maria: <reflect>Alright, he's answered that well, but I want to know more about the triple payout on covered holidays.</reflect>Okay, good point. But you also mentioned something about a triple payout if an accident happens on a covered Philippine holiday. What does that exactly mean?💬

Agent: Ah yes, the SafetyPro add-on! So, if your accidental death happens on a covered Philippine holiday, your beneficiaries receive three times the additional cash benefit. It's like an extra layer of safety for those extra-special days in the Philippines.

Maria: <reflect>That's an interesting feature, but I still have a few more questions about the policy charges.</reflect>Interesting! Now, about the policy charges, are there any hidden fees or extra costs I should know about?😯

Agent: I'm glad you asked. The policy has standard charges, and these will be clearly outlined before you even sign up. There's a minimum annual premium based on your chosen payment term, and additional premium may be required if the account value is insufficient. But we always ensure full transparency, no hidden fees!

Maria: <reflect>That sounds clear, but I should know more about how it works with my existing health insurance.</reflect>Thanks for clarifying! Now, how does this work alongside my existing health insurance? Will there be any overlap?💬

Agent: Great point, Maria. The Set for Life policy is primarily life insurance with investment benefits. If you have existing health insurance, perfect! You can use the Set for Life add-ons, like HealthPro or RecoveryPro, to complement it. These can bridge any gaps, especially when it comes to critical illnesses or hospitalizations where your regular health insurance might fall short.

Maria: <reflect>Okay, makes sense. I need to ask about that Waiver of Premium feature again.</reflect>Got it. And just to make sure, can we talk more about the Waiver of Premium? That sounded really helpful, lalo na if something happens.🙏

Agent: Certainly! If you're diagnosed with a major critical illness or face a total and permanent disability, the Waiver of Premium benefit kicks in. This means you won't need to make any further premium payments while still enjoying the full benefits of your policy. It's like a safety net that keeps your financial plan on track even if life throws you a curveball.

Maria: <reflect>This is a lot of information, but I feel like I’ve learned a lot. I'll ask one last question to wrap my thoughts.</reflect>That's really helpful. Thank you for elaborating. I think I have a much better grasp now. Just one last question—what's the process if I decide to move forward with this? How do I get started?🙆

Agent: I'm delighted you're considering it! The process is straightforward. We’ll first go through a needs assessment to tailor the policy and add-ons to fit your goals and budget. After that, we’ll proceed with the application and underwriting process. It's smooth and we’re here to help every step of the way.
