 Agent: So Maria, after going through all the details of our life insurance policies, what do you think? Are there any concerns or thoughts na gusto mong i-share?

Maria: <reflect>Ganda naman ng products nila, but I'm still not feeling the urgency to get insured.</reflect> Alam mo, parang I'm still not in a hurry to get insurance. Need to speak to my family muna eh. ðŸ™…

Agent: I understand, Maria. Itâ€™s important to make a family decision, lalo na sa ganitong bagay. Pero, have you thought about the security and peace of mind na kaya ibigay ng insurance, not just for you but also for your loved ones?

Maria: <reflect>He has a point, but still.</reflect> Yes, siguro, but itâ€™s not really a priority right now. I mean, I'm still young and healthy naman. ðŸ™†

Agent: True, being young and healthy is a blessing! Pero accidents and unexpected events don't really ask for age, diba? Thatâ€™s where the importance of insurance steps in, to protect you no matter what.

Maria: <reflect>Nakakatakot pag-isipan.</reflect> You have a point, but parang now is not the best time to decide. I need to think it over. ðŸ™†

Agent: I get that, making a decision like this needs ample thought. Kaya weâ€™re here to provide you with all the information and give you time to decide. Have you considered how insurance can secure your future plans, like for retirement or travels?

Maria: <reflect>Interesting thought, pero siguro ibang beses na lang.</reflect> Maybe, but like I said, itâ€™s not urgent for me now. I have other financial priorities din kasi. ðŸ™†

Agent: Thatâ€™s true, everyone has financial priorities. Ang kagandahan lang with our flexible payment schemes and terms, you can actually fit in insurance without compromising your budget.

Maria: <reflect>Sounds convenient, pero budget nga eh.</reflect> Medyo mahirap when there's still other expenses to think about. ðŸ™…

Agent: Totally understandable. But imagine, having an investment na both saving and protecting you. Isnâ€™t that worth considering for your financial well-being?

Maria: <reflect>He's persistent, but I'm still not convinced.</reflect> Maybe you're right, but still, I want to compare products ng ibang companies. ðŸ¤”

Agent: Definitely, itâ€™s good to compare din naman to see what fits you best. Pero let me assure you, FWD offers unique benefits that you might not find elsewhere. Most of our clients find our offers comprehensive and quite competitive. 

Maria: <reflect>He's confident in their product, but okay lang yun, comparison is important pa rin.</reflect> I prefer to do my own research muna rin. I don't want to overpay din kasi for coverage that I don't really need. ðŸ™†

Agent: Tama ka dyan. In fact, we can help you tailor-fit a policy that meets exactly what you need and nothing more. That way, you only pay for what you will really use.

Maria: <reflect>That sounds promising, but I'm still undecided.</reflect> Hmm, perhaps. But for now, like I said, I need to sit down with my family. 

Agent: Of course, take all the time you need. Itâ€™s good to have everyone's input sanamakatungong kayo sa best decision. Any other questions in mind na gusto mong pag-usapan? 

Maria: <reflect>I think I'll talk to him about another concern.</reflect> I also heard na minsan daw may premium increases without clear reasons. Is that true with your policies?

Agent: Good question, Maria. With FWD, transparency is a core value namin. Any adjustments on premiums are clearly communicated and justified based on a yearly review, to ensure fairness and that our clients understand the whyâ€™s behind them. 

Maria: <reflect>Well, it's good he's honest.</reflect> Okay, that makes sense. I'll definitely keep that in mind. 

Agent: I'm glad to hear that, Maria. Know that I am here to assist you with clarity and understanding. Donâ€™t hesitate if you have more questions or concerns.

Maria: <reflect>His assurance is comforting.</reflect> Thanks, Alex. Youâ€™ve been very helpful. I'll just take my time muna and discuss this with my family. ðŸ™†
