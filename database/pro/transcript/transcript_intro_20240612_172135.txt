 Agent: I heard it's been a challenging week for you. You mentioned something about a neighbor? 

Maria: <reflect>Since he's bringing up my neighbor, I'll mention it and my thoughts about getting older.</reflect>Oh yes, Alex. Actually, one of my neighbors recently passed away. Nakakalungkot and honestly, it got me thinking... I'm not getting any younger or healthier either. 🙅

Agent: I'm really sorry to hear that, Maria. It's always tough to lose someone close. Have you thought about how you can prepare for such uncertainties?

Maria: <reflect>He's leading towards discussing preparations and insurance probably.</reflect>Yes, and it makes me realize how important it is to prepare. Parang, when you’re young, you think you’re invincible. But then bigla na lang... Do you have any recommendations? 🤔

Agent: That's an excellent point, Maria. One recommendation talaga is having a solid life insurance policy. It can provide peace of mind in uncertain times. How familiar are you with life insurance options?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking about my familiarity with insurance; I'll share what I know.</reflect>Honestly, I know a bit pero not much. Parang, yung basic idea lang. I never really looked into the details before. 🙆

Agent: That's totally understandable. Many people feel the same way. Kaya nga I'm here to help you navigate through that. With FWD, we have a variety of plans tailored to different needs. What are your main concerns when thinking about the future?

Maria: <reflect>He's trying to gauge my concerns; I should share them.</reflect>I guess my main concern is making sure my family is taken care of in case something happens to me. You know, I don’t want to leave them in a bad financial spot. 🙏

Agent: That makes a lot of sense, Maria. One of the great features of our policies is that they can ensure financial security for your loved ones. Have you thought about what specific benefits you’d want from a policy?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking about specific benefits; I should tell him what I'm looking for.</reflect>Well, I'd like something that covers my medical expenses and also provides a good amount for my family if ever, you know, something happens. 🤔

Agent: That's a smart choice, Maria. Our policies offer comprehensive coverage that can take care of both medical expenses and provide a substantial payout to your beneficiaries. Are you aware of how much coverage you might need?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking about coverage needs; I haven't really thought about that.</reflect>To be honest, I haven’t really thought about the exact amount. Just enough to ensure my family doesn’t struggle financially. You have any suggestions? 🙅

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. A good rule of thumb is to consider your annual income and multiply it by 10-12, para may enough buffer for your family. How many dependents do you have?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking about dependents; I should tell him.</reflect>I have two kids. So if I go by your suggestion, that's a pretty big amount na rin huh? 🙆

Agent: Yes, but it's a smart investment for their future. Plus, you don’t have to pay it all at once—you can choose an affordable monthly premium. Have you thought about a budget for this? 

Maria: <reflect>He's asking about budget; I should give an estimate.</reflect>Well, I'm not sure about the exact budget, but I’m hoping something reasonable. Maybe you can give me an idea of what monthly premiums look like? 🤔

Agent: Of course, we can work within most budgets. Monthly premiums can vary depending on the coverage amount and policy type. For instance, a basic plan could start from a few thousand pesos per month. Does that sound like something you could manage? 

Maria: <reflect>He's giving a range; I should see if I can afford it.</reflect>I think that could work. Pero, how do I make sure I’m getting the best value for my money? 🙅

Agent: That's a great question, Maria. To get the best value, you should look at the policy's benefits, coverage limits, and additional features. With FWD, we offer flexible plans with benefits like critical illness coverage and investment growth. What’s more important to you: coverage, benefits, or investment potential? 

Maria: <reflect>He's asking what I prioritize; I should choose.</reflect>I think right now, coverage and benefits are more important for me. Investments are great, pero secondary sa akin. 🙏

Agent: That makes sense. We can definitely tailor a policy with those priorities in mind. Have you ever thought about adding riders to your policy for even more protection?

Maria: <reflect>He's mentioning riders; I need to understand more.</reflect>I’ve heard of riders pero not sure what they are. Can you explain a bit more about them? 🤔

Agent: Sure! Riders are additional benefits you can add to your policy. They can cover things like accidental death, disability, or even specific illnesses. They add more comprehensive protection to your plan. Is that something you’d be interested in?

Maria: <reflect>That sounds like extra protection; I should consider it.</reflect>That sounds really good, especially for peace of mind. Yes, I’m interested. What riders do you recommend for someone like me? 🙏
