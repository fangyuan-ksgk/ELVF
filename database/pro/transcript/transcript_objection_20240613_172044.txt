 Agent: So Maria, I hope you found our discussion about our products insightful. Would you be open to discussing anything further?

Maria: <reflect>He's asking me if I want to discuss more, but I have some concerns from our talk.</reflect>Sure, Alex. I have a few concerns actually. For one, I heard about premium increases without clear reason. Is that something I need to worry about? 🤔

Agent: That's a valid concern, Maria. At FWD, we ensure transparency when it comes to premium adjustments. Any increase would be communicated well in advance and would be based on comprehensive evaluations, not arbitrary decisions. 

Maria: <reflect>He says they ensure transparency, but I'm still unsure about switching to a company I haven't heard of before.</reflect>Okay, that sounds good. But I also have to ask, FWD is a new company, right? I haven't heard much about it before. 🙆

Agent: You're right! FWD might be relatively new in the Philippines, but we've been established globally for a while. In fact, we are backed by one of the largest insurance groups in Asia which gives us both credibility and strength.

Maria: <reflect>He's addressing the newness and mentions global backing. I'll ask about another concern.</reflect>I see. But I've read somewhere that you can't adjust the policy later on if needed. That worries me because my situation might change. 😔

Agent: Another excellent concern, Maria. Our policies are designed to be flexible and adaptable to your changing needs. You can make adjustments to your coverage or riders as your life circumstances change.

Maria: <reflect>He's giving me assurances, but I still prefer doing my research.</reflect>Hmm, that's reassuring. But to be honest, I still prefer to do my research before committing. Is that okay? 🙆

Agent: Absolutely, Maria. Doing thorough research before making any financial decision is very wise. We encourage our clients to fully understand what they are getting into.

Maria: <reflect>He's allowing for research, which is good. I'm starting to feel a bit better about it, but still cautious.</reflect>Thanks for understanding. I just want to make sure everything aligns with what I need. 🤔

Agent: Definitely, Maria. It's all about finding what's right for you. If there's anything specific you need help with during your research, feel free to reach out. We're always here to assist.

Maria: <reflect>He sounds supportive and willing to help with my research which is reassuring.</reflect>That's good to know, Alex. By the way, how does FWD compare to other insurance companies in terms of benefits? 🙆

Agent: Great question! FWD focuses on making insurance simple and accessible. We offer competitive benefits and a user-friendly digital experience which sets us apart from traditional companies. Plus, our customer service is known to be top-notch.

Maria: <reflect>He's emphasizing competitive benefits and digital experience. I'll keep that in mind as I research.</reflect>That sounds interesting. I like the idea of a user-friendly experience. Not all companies offer that. 👍

Agent: Exactly! We believe in convenience and efficiency for our clients. Have you taken a look at our customer reviews by any chance?

Maria: <reflect>I actually haven't checked reviews yet. It's probably a good next step.</reflect>No, I haven't yet. But that's definitely something I plan to do. Reviews can tell a lot about a company. 🙆

Agent: Absolutely, they can. And if you have any questions or need clarification on something you read, I'm always a call away.

Maria: <reflect>He's being very helpful and open about the process. This is good.</reflect>Thanks, Alex. I appreciate that. I'll go through some reviews soon.🤔

Agent: You're welcome, Maria. Just remember, at FWD, our aim is to support you every step of the way. Have you thought about what specific type of coverage you're interested in?
